1,"The bar chart below describes some changes about the percentage of people were born in Australia and who were born outside Australia living in urban, rural and town between 1995 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.",between 1995 and 2010 a study was conducted representing the percentages of people born in australia versus people born outside australia living in urban rural and town first in 1995 cities represented the major percentage of habitat by roughly 50 percent followed by rural areas and towns came in last among people born in australia on the other hand people born outside australia cities showed the most percentages of 6o percent followed by rural areas and towns in 2010 among people born in australia cities had an increase more than 20 percent increase in the total representation and a major decrease in towns and rural areas conversely people born outside australia cities had the most percentage among both studies followed by rural areas and towns ,5.5
2,"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",poverty represents a worldwide crisis it is the ugliest epidemic in a region which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways to tackle this issue rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible i agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid like providing countries in need with engineers workers and soldiers who would build infrastructure building universities hospitals and roadways by having a solid infrastructure poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term once unprivilged countries find their niche the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future however i do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty it does if used properly and efficiently the most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go is by identifying what type of poor countries representative are dealing with some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not with that being said implementing a strategy to distinguish responsible leaders from others would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use an example a clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized in summary types of aid varies from country to another and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries ,6.5
1,"The bar chart below describes some changes about the percentage of people were born in Australia and who were born outside Australia living in urban, rural and town between 1995 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.",the left chart shows the population change happened in austrilia from 1995 to 2010 in 1995 half of the people born in australia are from cities 30 from rural areas and only 20 are from towns for the people outside of australia most of the people still born in cities which is around 60 but the number of rural areas increased to 40 with the towns born rate decreased to only 10 in 2010 the people born in cities increased significianly in both in and outside australia especially in outside australia which reached 80 the people bore in towns decreased simutanuously to around 17 of the people born in australia and 10 of outside australia respectively the most significiant change happened at rual areas numbers it has shrinked to 17 of people born in australia and only around 5 of peopel bore outside australia overall the chart shows us the trend that many people moved to cities from rual area in the past 15 years ,5.0
2,"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",human beings are facing many challenges nowadays poverty is always an critical topic among countries especially the poverty in developing countries developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue i believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only money is essential to many factors like food contruction and hospital with money provided by developed countries govenment can improve the inforstructure supporting poor family with food building more houses for the poor people builing more schools to support children s education which is critical for people to get out of poverty but money cannot solve everything the poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor none of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment besides money could cause a bad habit to the governor they may reply on the financial support too much if the financial support ended someday which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance it will cause big trouble again devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money for example they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance authority of justice to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties which could have a long term benifit for the people there overall i am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions it may not the best solution for poverty ,5.5
1,"The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.",information about the thousands of visits from overseas to three different european natural places during 1987 and 2007 is provided in the given line chart overall it can be seen that the number of visitors increased significantly in the three places compared to the initial year although visits to europeans lakes demostrated more changes over the 20 years than its counterparts in more detail the most steady growth was experienced by the visits to europeans mountains for example from 1987 the number of visitors grew from 20 000 to almost the double 20 years later similarly visits to the coast also rose after a slight fall in 1992 reaching almost twice as much since 1987 with 75 000 those visiting europeans lakes subtantially increased over the years from 10 thousand to a peak of 75 thousand in 2002 despite falling for about 25 thousand in 2007 the visitis to this place remained higher compared to 1987 with 50 000 at the end of the period ,7.0
2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.",whether countries should only invest facilities and training on their elite athletes in order to win international competitions or give the same opportunities for all remains a big discussion in this essay i will explain both views and why i think participation for all is the way which brings positive consequences those supporting the first view believe that the odds to win are only high if the countries invest specialised facilities on their top sportmen this is because only athletes trained to reach the highest performance guarantee high scores for example it is known that china sends only its elite sportmen to compete in the olympics and statistically they usually win numbers of medals on the other hand those who support sports facilities and training for all athletes consider that non top ones can also have great opportunities to succeed for instance diego maradona a argentinian soccer player never played in a professional field on the contrary he was discovered playing in an old field located in a poor village this means that by providing facilities for all gifted sportmen might be discovered and they can make history too in my opinion as a supporter of the second view i believe that permiting everyone to train and use sports facilities is the best way to achieve international sports for me winning is as essential as participation besides this way leads to find natural talents among the local population which is inspiring for others in similar circunstances in conclusion although the two positions have strong arguments i think that the one supporting facilities for all people is the one that can bring positive developments to achieve sports events participation and inclusiveness may help to find gifted athletes among ordinary people ,6.5
1,"The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.",this graph depicts the changes in tourists visits between 1987 and 2007 to these three places in europe it s clear from the graph that generally the coast area have the highest number of visitors all over the years according to what is shown in the linear figure in 1987 period visitors first place was the coast with 40 visitor and in seconed place was the mountains with half number of coast s visitors and the lakes became lastly while the statistics have been changed at 2002 the lakes sharply increased to be the first place by reaching the highest number of it s visitors and the coast is the seconed finally at 2007 the coast speedly increased to be most place having tourists and the lakes dramaticlly declined to take the seconed place the rules switched between coast and lakes numbers to sum up the linear graph describe a constantly change in mountains visitors numbers and sharply changes in coast and lakes visitors numbers ,6.5
2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.",sports is an essential part to most of us some of us consider it a lifestyle and others consider it a job or source of income so it s a huge part in our live building specialized facilities to improve and develop athelets levels it s kind of encouragment to this category of people and it reflects enormous benefit to them either by providing to them the professional training or by make them ready to international competitions but narrowing the attention of sports to a specific category and ignore other categories actually doesn t sounds a good idea athelets consider as a important part of the community but the don t cover most of it and other people have the right to have sport facilities that suits their level and everyone whatever is it beginner or professional can use it sports is a public interest that doesn t include specific people in it and it s important to all genders and all ages so providing facilities to specific ones can end up with unfairness results in other hand providing this facilities to all public people will lead to increase in sport awarness and end up with more people having healthy lifesyle in conclousion according to medical facts said that s doing sport daily and make it essence in your life decreases heart attacks and raise the life quality specified just the athelets people with sports facilities is undesireable decision in other hand raising the number of gyms and sports areas will conclude with healthier society ,5.5
1,"The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.",the line graph illustrates the number of overseas tourists to three different areas in a european country coast mountains lakes from 1987 to 2007 overall it can be seen that the number of visitors has increased for the three categories of areas over the period given furthermore in 2007 the highest number of visitors was reported on the coast at approximately 85 thousand the second most popular areas were the lakes and last were the mountains in regard to the coast we can see that the number of visitors from 1987 to 1992 decreased however from 1992 to 2007 there was a consistently increased number of tourists climbing to over 70 thousand visitors in the final year of analysis about the mountains the number of overseas tourists begat at 20 thousand and has increased to reach over 30 thousand by 2007 finally the lakes were visited by 10 thousand tourists in 1987 and rose significantly to reach over 70 thousand in 2002 and then decreased to 50 thousand by 2007 ,8.0
2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.",international sports events require the most well trained athletes for each country in order to achieve this goal countries make an effort to build infrastructure designed to train top athletes although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country on the one hand building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as the olympics or the world cup the importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport in this way investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone on the other hand one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people however people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports for example people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home so for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that is not the case for training top athletes to sum up i strongly believe countries should invest in specialised infrastructure for their best athletes because in the long term is going to generate more motivation to do sports to invest in sports at schools and therefore to build more sports infrastructure for everyone ,9.0
1,"The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.",the graph provides information about the number of overseas visitors to three areas in a european country namely the coast the mountains and the lakes the data compare figures recorded in 1987 until 2007 overall the coast had the greatest number of visitors in the first year and will continue until the end of the study meanwhile among the three locations mountains were noted to be the least among the categories in detail at the start of the year the coast was noted to be the highest with 40 thousand visitors in 1987 in the succeeding year it had slightly decreased to 35 thousand however it had a sharp increased in number in follwing years and reached almost 80 thousand visitors at 2007 the lakes were observed to be in lowest number of tourists who visited the location at a number of 10 thousand in 1987 and this was followed by people who went to the mountains with 20 thousand visitors on the same year however in 1992 the two locations had identical pattern which rose up to over 20 thousand visitors respectively the mountains had a slightly contuinuous increasing pattern throughout the remaining years ending with 35 thousand visitors meanwhile the lakes continuous increased its number until 2002 with over 70 thousand visitors this figures however showed a drastically decreasing pattern with 50 thousand visitors at the end of 2007 ,5.5

Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.",athletes to be on the top need to have high end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities from my perspective this phenomena is a negative development being able to discover an individual s potential they need to have a support from any form of sources establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests talents and even skills in learning new things centers which offer utilities equipments and state of the art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports in addition building these kind of establishments not only for the purpose to train top athletes but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers this is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into they get to play along with peers discover one s potential and also learning from one another furthermore these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have in conclusion although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes i assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual s talents skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike ,5.5
1,"The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.",the graph bellow illustrates the amount of travellers who travelled between 1987 to 2007 to three different locations the coast the mountains the lakes in a particular european country we can see that over all the coast and the lakes had more visitors than the mountains the number of the coast visitors reached 40 thousands in 1987 then it declined to its lowest in 1992 by almost 35 thousand visitors and then it went up gradually to 75 thousand travelers in 2007 while the lake visitors started from 10 thousand in 1987 and continued rising until it reached its peak in 2002 by over 70 thousand travelers then it witnessed a severe fall and went down to 50 thousand visitors by the year 2007 unlike the lake and the coast which had their ups and downs the mountain areas had a slowly steady raise of number of visitors which started by 20 thousand visitor in 1987 and reached to almost 35 thousand visitors in 2007 ,6.5
2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.",it is often argued that some countries invist in devolping highly specialised training centers to train its top athletes to achieve international sports instead of facilitate and provide public training centers for everyone to use and to practice in my opinion i think both ideas together can contribue a very successful achievement in international sports for the country building highly specialised facilities by the country to train its top athletes can help the athletes to get an apropriate training give them the chance to progress faster and to be qualified to win or host international compititions like olympics for example if the country invists and build a large swimming center to train professional swimmers it is highly likely for them to win and get medals in international compititions on the other side providing various sport centers for the public use will encourage people to train and practice all kinds of sports more which leads to gaining more athletes to represent the country for example allowing and giving access to a young talented girls to practice their favorite sport like football ice skating bascketball and more will give them the apportinety to become a professional athletes who would benifit and represent the country in conclusion i think both invisting in building specialised facilities to train the top athletes to win and host an international compititions and invisting in providing sport centers for everyone to use to encourage and build more athletes could be benificial and counribue a highly international achievement in sports for the country it self ,6.0

2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.",there is some countries attain international sports by making and buliding unique specialised facilities to develop and improve top athletes rather than providing sports facilities that anyone else can use in my opinion i think that building specialised facilities to encahnce top athletes potential is essential and its such a positive development i also think that any sports player must have a good body and eat healthy food because a good physique can improve movement stamina and strength etc specially in the sports that depend alot on the body as an exmaple football basketball table tennis swimming etc and healthy food helps the athlete to achieve the physique that he wants and give him even more power and activity builiding specialised facilities is important because they will train them specificly on certain things in order to make them the best also they can focus on the athletes alone they are not going to be disturbed by people every athlete with his coach and that place only will be for the proffessnial athletes as an example in table tennis professional players play in their clubs because they have the best enviroment to be better they have amazing equipment such as the table the racket etc and they have the coaches all over the place and they can play with the players because they are all professional athletes additionally those player have to be very fit all of the top players are in extremely good shape their legs are built of metal in order to help them move quick in the table and the muscules helps with stamina if they are strong they can play more without getting tired so yes the facilities are very helpful and crucial to reach the top and they have to follow a specific diet from the professional coaches ,6.5
1,The pie charts below show the percentage of time working adults spent on different activities in a particular country in 1958 and 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.,information is presented in two pie charts which compare the amount of time in percentage that employees spent on six different activities in a country between 1958 and 2008 overall it can be clearly seen that while each activity that working adults did experienced a wide variety of changes working and sleeping were the most and the second most popular categories in both years respectively in addition the most significant change in employees behavior was travelling to work turning to first main feature working ranked first in activity that working adults spent their time on over the survey period contributing to 33 in 1958 and 42 in 2008 next sleeping ranked second in the activity that employees did in 1958 the amount of time that employees slept was an exact 32 before decreasing slightly to a precise 25 in 2008 turning to another main feature with respect to going out the popularity of this activity decreased noticeably from a modest 19 in 1958 to only 6 in 2008 nevertheless there was also an increase of 5 in relaxing at home in 1958 only 8 of working adults spent their time on this activity after that the popularity of this activity rose to a modest 13 in 2008 the last key point to note is travelling to work which rose fourfold from a precise 2 in 1958 to an exact 8 in 2008 ,8.5
2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?",there is currently a material issue that while the majority of students are eager to learn business or art in university there are only a few students who want to study science leading to numerous negative effects on community with respect to this matter there are also a wide variety of factors that influence the decision of students to not study science subjects it is undeniable that there are many reasons why undergraduates avoid studying science a classic example of this is that science is extremely difficult to understand in order to fully comprehend a particular scientific phenomenon students have to learn complex theories that cause the phenomena therefore they tend to choose other subjects that are easier to understand another common reason is a small amount of salary for working in scientific fields when student choose subjects to study at university they tend to enroll in an area that they could make a lot of money from having that knowledge since science career does not offer high remuneration student possibly prefer to study other subjects such as business which offers higher salary instead it is true that there are many negative consequences on society of having less undergraduates studying science one clear impact of this is the decreasing in innovation this is because scientific comprehension is a mandatory requirement for creating an innovation hence having only a few people who understand science will inevitably hold the creation of modern innovation furthermore the current environmental crisis such as an increase in global temperature would perhaps reach a point of no return since the crisis relates to environment which is one of scientific aspects having a small number of attention from students would lead to less social pressure to address this crisis properly in conclusion it is the fact that science is complicated and people who have scientific knowledge can make less money than those who are expertise in other areas resulting in less popularity in learning about science for university students moreover with the rise in this problem this trend possibly suspends the creation of new innovation and deteriorate the current environmental issues which are two most crucial matters for society ,8.5
1,The pie charts below show the percentage of time working adults spent on different activities in a particular country in 1958 and 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.,the two diagrams compare the proportion of time spent by adult workers in a specific country on different activities over a 50 year period from 1958 to 2008 overall it can clearly be seen that in 1958 adult workers divided their time roughly equally between work sleep and other activities however over the next five decades there was a remarkable increase in working hours a significant decrease in sleep time and the total time allocated to other activities remained nearly unchanged it is surprising that adult workers spent almost the same amount of time sleeping 32 as they did working 33 in 1958 however by 2008 they slept 7 less 25 and worked 9 more 42 which represents a remarkable increase in working hours as a result the time they spent at home for relaxation increased from 8 to 13 in contrast the time spent going out with friends and family declined dramatically by one third from 19 to 6 the most striking change however was the significant increase in time spent traveling to work which quadrupled from 2 to 8 over the 50 years ,8.0
2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?",in recent years many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities this is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society in this essay i will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications the first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend in general science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories formulas and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand furthermore they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life in other words it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses lastly it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future as a result students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing impractical and not promising for their future careers consequently the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society first and foremost there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology medicine and engineering this could lead to slow progress in these areas and society may suffer as a result moreover the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry which would have a negative impact on the nation s economy to sum up the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon the main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies this could have a negative impact on society as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine ,8.5

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.,the pie graphs illustrate the amount of time spent by a working class on six different activities working relaxing at home sleeping travel to work going out and others interests in a country in the year 1958 and 2008 overall the percentage of time spent on all activities had increased in 50 years but going out with friends and sleeping shows a decrease in 2008 as compare to 1958 in 1958 people spent one third of the time working which increased in 2008 by 9 and it remained the top priority among working adults however people spent the least time on travelling to work in 1958 which was 2 though by 2008 people started spending 8 of their time commuting to work it is evident from both the graphs that people spent almost one fifth of the time with their family and friends in 1958 which was the third most time consuming activity on the contrary in 2008 this activity became the least preferred activity with only 6 of the time people also deprived of their sleep in 2008 as it decreased from 32 to 25 ,6.0
2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?",in this essay we will talk about why in so many countries students do not prefer to choose science as a subject in the universities there are plenty of reasons for this problem and what effect does this have on society this essay will suggest many reasons for this problem the main reason of this problem is lack of trained math and science teachers if students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to persue science they will develop science and math phobia due to which they will prefer to choose any other stream than science to pursue their higher education eventually this will effect society in many ways if students stopped taking science as their majors their will be shortage of doctors because of that people will suffer from many health problems secondly if students do not take science as their major there will be no placement of science teachers for the future generation according to me government should take firm steps to stop this from happening there must be some training or some programs to keep teachers up to date to enhance their teaching this will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students for instance teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process to conclude i belive that government and teachers should take the responsibility to create the environment to learn these subjects in a fun way this will eventually increase the number of students enrolling for science subjects in coming future otherwise it may have negative impact on society which will not be a good sign for any country ,6.5

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.,the pie charts illustrate the proporation of time cost by different activities for the working adults in a certain nation in 1958 and 2008 looking from an overall perspective the percentage of time spent on working relaxing at home and other interests or playing sports were increased in the given years however the time of other three activities consumed were decreased at the same time in terms of the events which experienced an increasement of time the percentage of time of working rised 9 percent up to 42 percentage in 2008 and become the most time consuming activity the activities of relaxing at home and other interests or playing sports were seperately increased 5 percentage and 2 percentage in terms of time consuming as regards to going out travel to work and sleeping activities they were all decreased in different percentage of time the most noticiable one was going out with friends or family which dramatically droped from 19 percentage to 6 percentage approximately one third of the former proporation in 1958 as for the percentage of sleeping and travel to work they were both declined over the given fifty years ,5.5
2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?",recently more and more students choose to study finance management or other subjects instead of science in university around the world there are many reasons contribute to this phenomenon and this would definetely impose negative influences on our society in terms of the factors the reason is mainly due to the job market firstly we have to admit that the number of science job vacancies in the market is significantly lower than the other occupations like the nurse the accountant the lawyer and so on besides this the science is comparatively difficult than the other subjects if you want to be a qualified scientist you are more likely to spend more time on learning and researching maybe three years more than the other subjects so very naturally few people would like to take the risk of learning science however science does play an extremely important role in our society if not enough people study science it may impede the development of the country science represents the future of our nation because it could help to improve the development of technology and then make new technologies into pratical products a good example can be seen in the united states which has experienced a huge development in science during the past decades and has created a lot of advanced products such as the microsoft and artificial intelligence which has bring great benefits to this country in return and make it become the most powerful nation in the world in contrast if very few people learning science the nation may remain at a standstill and lose its competitiveness in conclusion although few people want to study science the government should take efficient measures to encourage the public to study this subject to help our society improving continuously in the long future ,5.5

2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem?

2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,these days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports this essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships first of all although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit not everyone is keen on football rugby and volleyball instead some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons these activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other as well on the other hand forcing children to play something they doesn t feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game which would make them feel excluded in addition teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players in some cases inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness instead it is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit if obese children took part in those team sports as well they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well in conclusion although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children as well therefore it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don t belong ,8.0

2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,there s an opinion around the ideal way to encourage and teach youngesters how to develop cooperetion skills and that is through team sports at educational facilities i completly agree with that opinion and this essay shall demonstrate some vital reasons to support my view a very important reason is that engrossing with teammates will naturally result in the evolvment in the infant s cooperation and cognitive skills through sociallizing with other same aged people the child meets new children and encounter certain events that will make them acuire skillfulness regarding cooperation for instance some parts of the world pour their focus on including activities in a context of teamwork in the school curriculum due to the knowledgable fact that working as a group for the child not only it devolops teamwork skills but also the cognitive ones experiencing failure and win will teach the offspring how to encourage their peers when they feel demotivated in order to reach a mutual goal also how to share and demonstrate their appreciation in terms of winning a comptetion i have obsorved my little brother when he plays in groups noticeablly he gets more motivated and happier when he wins alongside his team because he can express his gratitude and show sence of appreciation to his peers wich means he now developed coopreation skills in conclusion despite the fact that involving in teamwork kind of activity will yield the advancement regarding cooperation and cognitive skills for youngesters also encountering the results of a competition whether it was failure or winning will inevitably make them acuire skills to deal with such events that evenually make them better cooperatives ,5.0

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,the graph illustrates the process of transforming rainwater into drinking water in a city in australia overall it can be clearly seen that rainwater undergoes five sequential steps to become domestic tap water ready to be used in the house firstly roof drainage is installed for the collection of rainwater when it rains the water moves along the roof drainage and pipes lead into the water filter next the water filter removes basic pollutants such as leaves and sediments and begins the first step of water purification after that the water flows into a large square water storage tank and then inflows to the next tank for treatment when enough rainwater enters the treatment tank chemical substances are injected through a small device on top of the tank to sterilize and ensure the safety of water quality once the water is fully purified it is pumped into the house as a source of drinking water ,8.5
2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,many people believe that the most effective way to teach children cooperation in teamwork is by encouraging them to join team sports at school i completely agree with this idea and will give my reasons as follows firstly team sports require children to work together and practice communication in order to achieve a common goal for example in taiwan many schools have baseball lessons in sports courses and some schools even have a school baseball team in such courses children can learn to trust one another and develop communication skills by playing furthermore they can develop mutual understanding and compromise with their teammates in order to reach a common goal in this way they can develop their social skills find a way to cooperate and build positive relationships with their peers as a result team sports experiences will contribute to their social skills and social life as well secondly team sports can teach children the value of perseverance and resilience through the experience of competing with other teams children can learn to accept the ups and downs of success and defeat and go through any difficult situations with their teammates this is especially the case if they fail in a competition as they can learn to encourage each other and develop a sense of group belonging for instance we can see many touching stories in team competitions where despite being on the losing side at the beginning the team rallies and members encourage each other to restart this can be a great lesson for children to build their resilience self confidence and a sense of belonging as well as develop a positive attitude toward their life in the future in conclusion i believe that team sports provide children with opportunities to develop their social skills increase their confidence and resilience and ultimately benefit their whole life therefore they should be included in the school curriculum for children ,9.0

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,the diagram illustrates the way in which drinking water is produced from rain water overall converting water from nature into those for human daily use is a cyclical process that consists of collecting filtering storing chemical treating and making the new product for reuse after falling from the rooftop the water is collected by the gutter following the direction in the drain underground once there the water has to undergo the filter which mechanically removes its impurities this is the initial cleaning step for rainwater the water is then poured into a storage tank waiting for the next cleaning experience in this stage it is transported to the water treatment chemicals are essential for this process as they will deeply remove the residue that cannot be washed by the water filter and make water fit for consumption finally the water experiencing double cleaning process is delivered to households for different daily utilization and once it is used and becomes rain it goes through the recycling process all over again ,6.5
2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,the ability to associate at school has been a great concern owing to this some assume that the optimal way to boost children s collaborative spirit is through school team sports in my opinion teaming up in school sports would be problematic and therefore should be implemented in certain occasions with certain individuals initially participating in team sports would put a tremendous risk in injuries inevitably physical group activities require high speed movements resulting in harsh collisions students then may lose their interest in those activities or hesitate to attend in order to avoid any kind of damage to their body another point to consider is that joining team sports can effortlessly breed serious competition among teammates therefore at that time the objective of cultivating cooperation would be replaced by the desire for accolades in children s mind this consequently spells trouble for the hostile environment as the feeling of inadequacy and low sellf esteem in students are growing finally the best solution would be offering team sports as an optional project for students to illustrate a school football match can open more opportunities for those into soccer and accept to play in unity in this case participants may have a chance to immerse themselves in a joint effort after being thoroughly disseminated about the rules as a result they are still able to enjoy the game while working in a joint project in conclusion boosting children association by teamsports may not be feasible for all of them but operating more joint projects for those with passion and fair play is a much better approach ,7.5

2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,there is currently a contentious argument that the most effective method for young people to learn about cooperation is by doing team sports rather than other alternatives despite the fact that doing sports as a team could inarguably strengthen collaboration skills of children i personally believe that there are also other vital ways to upskill them in this aspect it is true that doing team sports could possibly lead to the collaboration of children a classic example of this is that they have to jointly cooperate with other team members in order to achieve the team s goal this is because reaching the goal in team sports requires each member to not only do their responsibility but also to help other members to maximize the performance of the team in addition supporters of doing team sports may argue that children will also learn to communicate with other members which is one of key factors for cooperation as a result when young people have better communication skills they tend to be willing to collaborate with other people in any situation in spite of the aforementioned positive effects on juveniles with respect to the cooperation the juveniles could also be encouraged to cooperate by working in a group as another alternative way a common example of this is they have to think from other perspectives which is an essential skill for collaboration when juveniles work with other people they would inevitably encounter with a wide variety of ideas which they might disagree with therefore they have to understand the ideas from the others point of view in order to reach a consensus furthermore another key point for cooperation that adolescents will learn is delegation this is because tasks that a group has to complete might requires various knowledge hence adolescents have to delegate each task to each group member based on the expertise in conclusion it is undeniable that doing team sport will positively result in the collaboration of children since they would get exposed to situations requiring them to help and communicate with other team members nevertheless i totally disagree with the notion that team sport is the best way to teach children to collaborate since doing assignment in a group could also teach and motivate them to cooperate with other people in terms of thinking from other points of view and work delegation ,8.0

2,"While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?",whether people should be encouraged more to study vocational courses due to the lack of workforce in that area or be encouraged to study at the university remains a big discussion i believe both of these areas of study should be promoted equally countries need academics as well as qualified workers one of the reasons that supports the encouragement to study either area academic or vocational is the worldwide need for the two types of professionals for example australian government is currently offering work visas and permanent residencies to overseas qualified workers such as carpenters cooks bar managers as well as doctors nurses and psychologists essentially this demonstrates that the two areas are equally needed and this happens in canada and england too another point to be considered is the increase in the people s needs due to the population growth which therefore affects the need for more experts in all sectors this includes professional from different fields such as science construction and even thinkers if people is encouraged to study more in one field than others this might be detrimental to societies leaving one sector significantly more affected eventually countries need a balance in the areas choosen for people to growth a career in conclusion i support the idea of encouraging both university and vocational studies many countries worldwide have expressed their need for the two types of workers besides as the population is rapidly increasing the need for experts in multiples areas is increasing too so promoting both is the only way to maintain a balance ,7.5

2,"While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?",some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas i agree with this proposal to some degree because from my knowledge there is a lack in both fields academic and vocational experts moreover academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society and not everybody can study the same thing so both studies should be encouraged qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world this is because as the population grows the people s needs do it too and this happens in all shapes and areas while living in argentina i noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology especially robotics in england however i observed the lack of plumers and carpenters consequently every country needs different things furthermore if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only this could be detrimental to the academic field essentially both study systems are equally important a hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building besides not everybody is good at everything some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking in my family i am the one who studied at the university but my sister studied dressmaking both of us have jobs nowadays in conclusion i believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated countries worldwide are in lack of different experts either in the vocational or academic field hence both workers are equally essential and needed besides and more importantly not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area ,6.5

2,"While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?",in today s era most students look forward to enrolling in professional courses at universities however some believe that authorities should encourage teenagers to take vocational courses as there is a huge shortage of professionals like electricians and plumbers in my opinion while there is a scarcity of such workers and the government should make special arrangements for prospective learners certain other factors should also be considered due to the insufficient work possibilities after completing vocational courses and extremely low wages scholars are forced to take loans at high interest from banks to attend university programmes an average adult has to pay more than 70 000 usd yearly for a typical professional course at a university and most children are unable to accumulate sufficient funds in time which forces them to borrow this amount from banks the job market for plumbing and electrical work is highly unregulated which leads to the exploitation of such workers by the established brands further distressing the people some regulations should be established for these markets to decrease the risk factor for workers on the other hand due to the continuing increase in our population the demand for doctors engineers and professors is also rising in recent years governments from all over the world have reported the widening gap between the number of professionals available per 1000 people for example in india there is only 1 doctor available per 50 people in urban areas and the number is even more concerning in rural areas where the figure of patients climbs even further in my opinion authorities and universities should work together towards introducing scholarships and other benefits not only for learners of professional courses but also for peoples of vocational courses furthermore better and more wages for plumbers and electricians could also be established to attract more students in conclusion favourable policies should be implemented for qualified workers to attract more potential learners by the government as well as lower tution fees for university attendees ,9.0

2,"While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?",nowadays with the development of education more and more students go to colleges for academic learning however some people consider that we should provide more vocational courses because a lack of practical workers such as electricians and plumbers personally i think academic study is obviously important bacause it can improve the technology and the misunderstanding of job not the lack of vocational training is the main reason for a lack of labored workers it is no doubt that the academic learning in university can induct the practical training and provoke the development of technology in different areas such as agricuture if we deeply understand the theory of academic knowledge and reasonablely apply them in different fields we could efficiently improve the technology and help human beings to increase their living standard for instance the development of drones turly improve the quantity of crops which is benifit for famers however this technology need a lot of basic theories to invent the drones and teach worker to handle this machine at this time the academic study becomes much more important for practical workers some people claim that it is because a lack of vocational training thus leading to a lack of qualified worker however in my opinion i think there are mainly two reasons come from the misunderstanding of jod cause this bad situation for one aspect some people think that practical workers usually cannot earn much more money compared to empolyees working in office thus they just give up this occupation for their career for another aspect some people do not respect those qualified worker which make them feel their job are secondary at last there are no more people would like to choose this type of works in conclusion i think academic study is very much important for students to improve the technology and the lack of practical workers is not because of less provided vocational training but the misunderstanding of job between some people ,6.0

Discuss both views and give your own opinion",according to some people administration should stop the sports that are risky while few others have an opinion that individuals should have liberty to perform any kind of sports or activity in my opinion critical sports should be stopped because it not only dangerous but harmful for others as it attracts youngesters firstly the sports activities which are risky should be banned by the government as they are the only ones who can actually stop this life taking so called adventure and put a full stop infact people specially youngsters get affected as they get easily influenced and under peer pressure perform these tasks without any guidance or safety for instance road racing which is the major cause for accidents in many countries which not only effect them but the public arround another example is death s well where car drivers drive the car in a well in circular motion where their is no guarantee of life where at any moment people can die secondly everyone should have right to perform sports or activities according to their taste however safety is the primary concern that one should keep in mind while stopping all the ones which can actually take a life should not be performed as a result these dangerous events has various outcomes majority of the performers turnout to be handicapped or with broken bones so guidelines and measures taken by government is necessary in conculsion the risky sports activities should banned and government should only allow the events with keeping the risk in mind and the after effects of the activity that what influence will it have on people of diiferent age criteria ,7.0

2,"Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion",the increasing prevalence of furious sports has been a great concern owning to this some assume that the governments should abolish this type of sports while others contend that citizens should have a right to immerse in any activities regardless of its high risk characteristics in my opinion the policies ought to focus on participants s assurance instead of banning any sports on the one hand the propose of prohibiting extreme sports should not be approved because it is against the democratic society inevitably the participating in risky sports is one of residents rights as a result the intervention of the admistrations in this case will prevent them from their own interests illegally moreover the extreme sports abolishment may extinguish carreers and dreams of numerous professional athletes and trainees therefore banning is not a reasonable approach in this situation on the other hand authorizing freedom in playing dangerous sports generates several matters understandably participants mostly risk their health and lives being involved in these activities from violence and physical injuries which means the furious characteristics are posing a threat to their own existences in addition the prohibition on those sports can orientate hobby development for future generation on healthy sports requiring less violence and intension this therefore leads to a more tranquil community finally according to my perspective the administrations should attempt to handle safety assurance and enhance risk education in those players under this circumstance the residents are equipped with protective support and still allowed to enjoy and follow their passion this then would be the optimal way to meet residents demand conclusively i personally believe the solution is not about whether the governments should forbid furious sports activities but about providing them protective assurance and risk acknowledgement ,5.5

Discuss both views and give your opinion.,whether parents should fully intervene in their children s organization of their leisure time or let them decide it remains a big discussion in this essay i will contrast the two opinions and i will explain why i think a good balance is needed one of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children s ability to organize this is because although some of them might seem very mature for their age others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine besides playing video games for instance many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill time managment on the other hand some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth this view therefore opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like having multiple options for example children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class in my opinion parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children s lives but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities this may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children moreover children learn responsability while being guided by their parents in conclusion some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely i believe parents should always be involved in their children s lives and decisions allowing children participation too which brings multiple benefits to their relationship ,7.0

2,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,the gap year is an issue that has sparked debate it is widely accepted that young people should travel or work for a year between completing high school and beginning university studies from a personal perspective the benefits are more significant than the drawbacks for young people who decide to have a gap year on the one hand most students who just completed high school education have stressful periods and lots of plans that want to do young people could feel disoriented which means they need time for finding what they want there are a lot of youths who put themselves under pressure thus they get more and more stress in their study and work and can get some mental illness in order to have a gap year they will have enough time to relax and establish a plan for their future nowadays more and more students decide to choose a year to do anything that they hope to perform besides their decision will help them understand themselves and have opportunities to experience jobs that have not been done before such as volunteer work and long day traveling on the second hand there are some negative points of a gap year for the youths the young people who decide to have a free year will face late completing university studies which may lead to having fewer opportunities than their peers deciding to start university immediately on some occasions it is difficult for young people who do not have any experience to find internship jobs thus they may waste lots of time without any achievement to sum up the gap year will bring more experiences for young people it is my belief that the advantages outweigh the others ,6.5

2,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,over decades there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university with a careful consideration there are also negative points of this it is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles development a classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences when juveniles have work experiences such as having a one year internship in a company they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture this is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university in spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses there are also drawbacks a common example of this is graduating from a college late compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school this is exemplified by thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path in addition opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes the juveniles should study at university instead in conclusion it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom nevertheless doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working ,7.5

2,The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,there is currently a contentious argument that using english as an international language will always have more benefits than drawbacks despite the use of english which has been spreading globally has positive effects on communication in various aspects i personally believe that the disadvantages of the spread of english will eventually be more significant it is true that when more and more countries use english as a common language the advantages of this implementation will outweigh its negative consequences a classic example of this is that people from any country could communicate to each other in the easier way this is because there will be no language barrier preventing people to deliver their messages to others furthermore using english globally tend to have less misunderstanding when communicating this is exemplified by natives who live in the same country and speak the same language these people can understand what each other say completely therefore in terms of global perspective if everyone has conversations in english misleading communication tend to be less occurred in spite of the aforementioned positive consequences of the growing use of english there are also potential drawbacks a common example of this is the missing of some languages languages which are only used by small groups of people tend to fade away due to the fact that the majority of people would pay more attention to english without conserving these languages in addition nations that do not apply english as an international language tend to have small global economic growth this is because most countries in international markets can understand english hence countries whose people are unable to apply english could inevitably have less opportunities to make commercial deals with other countries having the ability to speak english in conclusion it is undeniable that the spread of english positively affects the way people from different countries communicate to each other and significantly decreases inaccurate information in conversations nevertheless as this development can lead to the lost in other languages and the declining economy of some countries i totally disagree with the notion that the advantages of the increasing popularity of english will continue to outweigh the disadvantages this is because i personally think that the aforementioned negative impacts are the two most crucial aspects when using english ,8.5

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",in reality translation softwares makes a lot of people s lives easier when communicating with others that don t speak the same language however in my opinion learning a new language might be more advantageous than using this software first of all the process of learning new languages involves the ability to correspond words in two different dialects which also requires using a lot of parts of our brain therefore this process improves certain areas of our neurologic system specifically the left hemisphere responsible for communication and speech in fact multiple studies have shown that people that speak different idioms have a lower risk of neurologic diseases such as alzheimer s and dementia since the left side of the brain is more developed than others that might only know one language furthermore these types of software are not always accurate in spite of being correct the majority of the time there are some situations where the translation is wrong because of different factors one of them is that there s no translation for certain words in other languages for example saudade in portuguese has no correspondence in english besides that when using google translate one has to pay attention to the translation given in certain languages in reality when translating from english to portuguese sometimes the programme doesn t consider the fact that in portuguese adjectives come after the noun while in english they came before lastly someone that chooses to use this type of system to communicate with someone instead of learning that language loses a bigger amount of time than others that already speak that dialect that is because one has to first record what the person is saying then tell the software their answer and wait for it to be translated to the other this results in a quite complicated setting that might be aggravated in situations where the translator doesn t understand one of the persons involved in the conversation to illustrate this when talking to the ai siri on the iphone or alexa on google a lot of the time they don t comprehend what we are saying which results in people having to repeat themselves several times in conclusion i believe that learning a new language is easier than using a translation software in fact this not only boosts our knowledge but also avoids difficult situations where what people are trying to say is wrongly translated ,8.0

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",i believe students should be divided according to their academic ability this is because specific students require different amounts of support according to their abilities students that are divided based upon their academic ability are more likely to learn specific parts of their subjects this will help students not only to learn more but also help them gain more confidence so that they can believe in themselves and so that they are more likely to understand the information required by their subject as they are recieving extra help however if students are divided according to their academic ability they are more likely to feel bored as they may not have their peers to interact with and there s also a high chance that the students may feel isolated as they believe they feel like they do not have the knowledge requirements for their subjects which can demotivate the students and further leading to poor grades if students are educated together they can feel like that their not left out and they can help recieve information from their peers which can help them further understand the subject however if the students are educated together there s a high chance that they are more likely to be distracted by their peers and they would be less focused on their subjects which can lead too poor grades morever if students are educated together there s also a chance that specific students may not understand what the teacher is teaching or talking about as diffrerent students have different understandings and academic abilities overall i believe students should be divided according to their academic abilities this is because students are more likely to understand the information provided by their teachers as they are provided with additional support and students should be more mature enought to undertsand that if they do not meet specific academic requirements they should not be demotivated they should understand how to handle the situation and show that they can be courageous enough to do even better as the students are provided with additional support ,7.5
1,"The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.",the schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods overall they show flood protection with and without a stopbank while the at risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures the first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding the stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100 year flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank resulting in an area of internal ponding if it had not been a stopbank as described in the second diagram there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding in this case the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture the height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100 year flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house this measure is called the freeboard ,7.5

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",nowadays people hold different ideas about how to distribute students at schools some individuals argue that minors should be taught separately based on their academic performance whereas others state that they ought to be educated together this essay will discuss both viewpoints although it is my opinion that it is better to allocate students together regardless of their capabilities proponents of the idea of dividing children at different levels argue that the selection can better facilitate an efficient and productive learning environment for different students more specifically by doing so schools can provide specific objectives to meet students needs as young people have distinctiveness in learning preferences personalities and interests therefore through selecting and separating the youth into a range of classes based on their talents and intelligence schools cannot only tailor a result oriented syllabus to explore each student s maximum potential but also improve the quality of education since excellent students can learn in a fast way without anyone being left behind in contrast ordinary students can still keep up with the majority with complete comprehension furthermore this can also minimise the possible pressure that some academically challenged students suffer from the negative psychological impacts considering their poor performance in the exams or assignments others however who point out that mixed classes attach great importance to the contribution of healthy competition and collaboration also make valid arguments despite the possible imbalance in each student s academic performance in a class superior peers can serve as a desirable role models to others their strengths such as learning attitudes and methods can enlighten the rest of the class to improve and study in addition the diversity in class can promote mutual study among children with different abilities and create a better environment for children s all rounded development since the way of streaming students has been proven effective and practical this mode of teaching is highly advisable by educational experts and there are still many schools following this norm to educate children rather than set them apart as many students who are not excellent at study may experience disappointment and a lack of confidence when compared to those straight a students in separated classrooms in conclusion although the teaching resources can be assigned more precisely to target youngsters gifts in the streaming it is still too early and unfair at this stage therefore i believe it is better to mix students with different levels of abilities in a dynamic and harmonious class and undoubtedly we should never discriminate unfairly against students who should be highly encouraged instead ,8.0

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,the public is rarely found agreeing on one opinion one might take a simpe problem such as manufacturers responsible for excessive packaging or customers should avoid buying such goods as example let me tackle this problem in brief manufacturers and supermarkets may be noticed selling their goods excessivly packaged and that may dissatisfy a portion of their customers those customers believe that such sellers should reduce such packaging looking into it it sounds that sellers would also be responsible if their goods where damaged which would lead to a decrease in income it also does cost a little more to wrap goods securely to avoid damage so while that may be a little inconvenient for manufacturers it is necessary to avoid serious losses later on customers have full right to avoid excessivly packaged goods if it so contrasts their taste they may feel it is tiresome to unwrap or hard to get rid of all the mess it creates afterwords they would think that is a manufacturer s task to unwrap the goods once they are available at the market or even once the arrive at their houses if it is an online service it would logically seem much convenient to them to have instant access to their product instead of all the unpackaging that preceeds the unboxing purchased goods personally i believe a little unwrapping isn t so invonvenient and it doesn t have to fall on a manufacturer to unwrap his goods before selling a little unpackaging might even be thrilling sometimes to build up excitement before unboxing your awaited product i d add with little offense meant that people are getting a little lazy to do a simple task as unpackaging ,7.0

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society in order to reduce the amount of packaging some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality in my view the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal on the one hand the problem of over packaging is often caused by commercial strategy the supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers it is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price following that producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap therefore it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance on the other hand the behaviors of customers give rise to over packaging as well the more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping moreover the public awareness about the harmful influence of over packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging as customers take the problems caused by over packaging into account they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly in conclusion it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over packaging therefore the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both ,8.5

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,opnions are divided on whether manufacturers and supermarkets should reduce the numbers of packaging of products or consumers should not buy over packaging goods from my perspective although asking customers take this action is reasonable i strongly hold that these service providers should play a more important role in this issue on the one hand the reason why some people think customers should have more duties is that it ia driven by their demand to be more specific this is because they choose to buy some things with good packaging but these goods are usually over packaged hence if they reduce their demands for such products producers and sellers naturally stop over package them to avoid a reduction in their busidness profits for example more and more people are persuaded to simply use a piece of paper to wrap the gift box instead of using a large number decorations on the other hand they think it is driven by merchants as they have more control on it specifically in order to sell goods better they uauslly regard packaging as a tool to attract purchasers in addition if their competitors find it does help the sale of products it also promote the competition on the packaging which can further lead to excessive packaging take fast food for example it is obviously that sometimes using just one bag can fit all food but to gain a greater advantage over the competition they may use a box or more to wrap them and then it creates a vicious cycle of over packaging in conclusion even though customers can help to solve this case i believe manufacturers and supermarkets should take the main responsibility to reduce over packaged goods becasue if all sellers are competiting on it customers will have no choices ,7.0

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,in recent years a variety of crimes and other violent news on television in newspapers as well as on the internet report might have increased to a few decades ago although some people might be concerned these reports have adverse consequences i disagree the news should be reported continuously to begin with some parents might be concerned that these reports might be harmful to their children children tend to be susceptible to any information including enjoyable news and heavy crime news therefore some parents just hope their children watch some healthy news such as entertainment sports and technological innovation news on the other hand some crimes including violence and murder cases should not diminish the volume of news recently the japanese media tend to hide the actual violent scene in addition reporters and writers tend to explain the detail in the verbal report or detail in letters this news must be helpful for parents to prepare some ideas for their children in order not to be involved in some dangerous crimes for example parents recently give a cell phone to children to contact any time in addition the parents can observe where the children are 24 7 by taking advantage of gps finally japan is one of the safest countries across the globe therefore japanese people tend to overrate the japanese society that crimes including violence will never happen to our life in contrast looking at some reports of crimes and other kinds of violent news will be a great trigger to educate children in order not to be murdered and avoid kidnapping by criminals in conclusion it is necessary to report crimes and other kinds of violent news for all people to prepare unpredictable future ,5.5

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,nowadays more and more criminal activities and violent events are showed on television and in newspapers some people consider that we should restrict those kinds of information because of the adverse outcomes however in my opinion those events shown in the media should not be restricted for the following reasons firstly reporting of criminal activities and other violent news can reduce crimes if those criminal and violent information can be showed to the public people can clearly understand the whole process and detailed scenes of crimes provoking them more easily think critically serious consquences abusing durgs for example people will be afarid of the severe effects on both social and personal areas when they vivily see real outcomes it may bring thus prevent them from committing criminal acts hence there will be fewer criminal activities or violent events occurring on our society that is why we should not restrict criminal activities being shown in the media in addition restricting the criminal activities may lead to a high rate of crimes if people cannot easily obtain those information they may consider that no one care about it and even take part in some criminal activities without thinking because they cannot image detailed impacts on social and personal aspects when they think wether can do it or not finally to a large extent they may commit cirmes and cause some severe consquences which may bring nagative effects on society in conclusion i agree that we should show criminal activities and violent events in the media which can largely reduce crimes moreover we should also think much more about that restricting this kind of information may lead to a high rate of crimes ,6.5

2,Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,nowadays it is often said that mass media interest in reporting crimes and violence happening in our society may lead to negative effects therefore there is a public debate over the opportunity of excluding this kind of news from mass media such as newspapers or television in this essay i will summarize the grounds for my stance which is completely in favour of this viewpoint the mair reason why i believe that crimes and violence news should be restricted is the emulation risk in this view television is often watched by kids left alone who may not be able to fully undestand what they see therefore if they continue to hear about violence and crimes they may begin to consider them as a normal part of our society and start adopting these behaviours for instance a teenager may think that it is normal to fight with someone else in case of an argue outside pubs or clubs another reason in favour of crimes and violence news restriction is the exaltation of criminals this may be epitomised by serial killers on one side they are sentenced for terrible crimes but on the other hand are sometimes proposed to accept a huge amount of money in order to make interviews or write books about their stories if media did not talk about these crimimals none of them would earn money as a consequence of its guilts in conclusion i believe that there are many valid reasons for claiming a reduction of violence and crimes news on social media emulation of wrong behaviours by young people and enrichment of criminals are two of the most common arguments all thing considered i strongly advocate the need of restricting mass media s time spent to talk about crimes and violence this aim may be pursued by public authorities through the promulgation of new laws and rules ,7.0

2,Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,people tend to use more informal words in their language to express and communicate with each other rather than following formal words there are several reasons for this and i believe that it has some disadvantages and advantages the key contributor to informal writing is technological innovation for instance whatsapp facebook messenger and instagram allow people to send texts to each other anywhere and anytime just by connecting to the internet furthermore the texting culture of using abbreviated phrases has grown increasingly prevalent as a result applying casual language in written form has become more popular and this substantially affects the written language i believe that this trend may carry a certain degree of risk firstly when using written language in an easier going way many times people can forget how to write a formal letter in fact the current generation gets used to texting so the young are not aware of how to write a formal email to apply for a job instead they write these emails like they are texting with friends secondly informal writing can adversely affect the academic performance of students the students tend to utilize abbreviated words or slang in essays and assignments that require a greater level of formality one evident benefit to having more informal written communication in our professional lives is that it is less time consuming for instance busy individuals working on the same task can share information instantly through a quick chat rather than write a long and formal mail chain that requires thoughtful editing and proofreading in conclusion although there are disadvantages to using informal words in written language there are also attractive advantages i believe individuals should use informal words when texting with family and friends but when it s an office or business related work then they should use formal words in written language ,7.0

Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,it is noticeable that when we write something we try to use more informal language moreover the written text is more redundant cohesive calm and patient from my point of view it comes because we erase emotions from written text which we spread sometimes without intention via voice not only voice influence on it but during the writing we have a chance to revise and check our text moreover this fact has advantages and disadvantages on the one hand there is a huge advantage of this cartain when we communicate through formal language and when we are more relaxed we have a chance to spread our ideas more thoroughly for instance i sometimes observe that for me it is easier to convince someone to help me if i write to him or her on the other hand there is a disadvantage that when we switch on to the speech from writing other people will be surprised or astonished with the differences for example during my work i communicate via messages more than via calling sometimes there are cases when after this switching people notice that i was rude and insult them finally written language is more relaxed and less formal this fact has a lot of cons and pros i think that cons dominate under pros what is more it is a nice way to mix this kind of communication for best results neither written way nor speaking will increase your chance to be recognizable in the right way if your basic idea is not relevant to consumers of your main idea ,5.0
1,"The diagram below shows how oil is expected in use of production of perfumeSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.",the given process chart illustrates how perfume is obtained using oil as an ingredient overall the product undergoes 4 main steps which involve prevalently water and the usage of heating and cooling down methods in addition to a separation machine before being ready to be used to create a fragrance for starters the water is placed in a metal tank and brought to the boiling point through direct flames then the steam is conducted by a pipe to another cistern where aromatic plants are added in order to obtain oil vapor mixed with steam right afterward the mixture goes into a pipe system where a condensation process takes place thanks to a condenser that uses cold water in doing so the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is after that water mixed with essential oil reaches the last tank in which a separator proceeds to take essential oil apart this way only the aromatic water is able to proceed and it is possible to use it in the perfume industry ,7.0

Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,nowadays most people tend to write in a more informal way adopting a relaxed approach this essay will cover the reasons why this behavior is so common starting from the necessity of a more quick way to communicate and then it will attempt to illustrate if it has advantages and disadvantages hence the necessity to interact in a quicker way due to the business of life at the present time many people prefer to cure less the formal aspects of their written pieces this rapidness has been allowed by the spread of emails as the principal mean of written communication likewise the reader itself having much less time is prone to take just a rapid look at the emails not caring much if the way they are written is formal or not on the one hand this can lead to some advantages such as a more relaxed atmosphere even in workplaces for example many workers are relieved to know that their boss is keen on writing informal emails and does not pretend his subordinates to do otherwise moreover it has some positive implications also for strangers that are often less prepared to write in a formal style on the other hand it is often hard to draw a limit some readers can think that the person sending the informal email is just being rude leading to a misunderstanding this is particularly true when the generation gap is taken into consideration generally elder people may be less willing to receive an informal letter in conclusion the reasons behind a more relaxed style in written language may be found in the faster means of communication this has undoubtedly advantages such as the creation of a more peaceful ambient albeit there are also clear disadvantages for instance the misinterpretation of the context ,7.0

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,it is argued by some individuals that men aren t skilled enough as women in regard to leadership this essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people s personality and work experience the role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender for example women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist indeed several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender some of those attitudes are related to active listening emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities thus if effectively developed and fostered those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management in the same way the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills for example a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families indeed most of the women apply for part time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities for this reason is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership to conclude the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people s personalities regardless of their gender moreover the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view ,7.5
1,"The diagram shows a process of making a storage area from a material called concrete canvasSummarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.",the given diagram illustrates the process of the storage area which is made from a special material namely concrete canvas the process can be outlined in eight consecutive steps beginning with the manufacturing of the concrete canvas and culminating with storing of goods firstly the concrete canvas is produced as a three layers composite it consists of a fibrous top surface a layer of dry concrete and a waterproof layer the features of each layer play different roles in later usage in terms of ductility and stability the finished product of the concrete canvas is then packaged in boxes and delivered by truck to the construction site where the boxes are unwrapped and the canvas inside is taken out in the next stage the concrete canvas is spread by means of a rope drawn by a vehicle in order to fix the canvas on the ground pegs are used and hammered every ten meters along each side of the canvas after that on one end of the spread canvas a door is installed as the entrance of the storage the covered space between the canvas and the underground is then pumped up and expanded with the aid of a blower machine following that water is sprinkled over the surface of the swollen canvas and reacted with dry concrete with the aim of generating a hard shell for storage thus the form of storage is constructed after a set period of around 20 to 24 hours the storage can be put into use ,8.5
2,Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,it is true that gender equality has achieved significant advancements nowadays compared to society in the past and women have no doubt obtained more opportunities to get engaged in the leading role on many occasions with regard to many success stories about female leadership there is a common statement that women are more suited to be leaders in my opinion leadership depends more on ability rather than gender there are several reasons why some people may consider females as the better choice to occupy the leading position firstly female leadership is a relatively new trend in recent decades with the development of society and therefore has been put under the highlight in the past men were always seen as the superior gender to run the company and dominate the realm at the same time women were seldom taken into account to be qualified to do management and in many cases they were merely not eligible for leadership hence the opportunity and success of female leadership nowadays are highly emphasized and kept firmly in people s minds which probably leads to the imagination that women can better lead secondly the statement can sometimes be regarded as propaganda for gender equality in order to improve public awareness of the female role in leadership and create more chances for women to partake in leading it is surely an excellent idea to set a good image of female leadership by advocating their merits however the decisive factors to successful leadership which include capacities like communication personal charisma and intelligence should not be misinformed despite the argument given above i also believe that it is urgent to replace the stereotype of gender among the public which contributes to the distinct impression of each gender about leadership the male characteristics were traditionally defined as braveness intelligence and dominance which match the requirement of leadership a lot it is no doubt that women can be brave and able to take risks and responsibility in the leading position as well a prime example can be female chancellor merkel of germany who led the german government for more than 16 years and enjoyed a well known reputation worldwide her political legend reflects the fact that the extraordinary competence of leadership does not exclusively belong to males in conclusion although i completely agree that gender equality is of unparalleled importance however the key to successful leadership should never be related to gender ,8.0

2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,it is undeniable that nowadays smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one s life through countless websites and applications people can connect with each other without any boundaries while many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships i personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods first and foremost social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances previously people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule however the internet allows them to update their plans at any time this means that if there is any emergency an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan furthermore there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart the current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends in the past it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events nowadays online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually thus fewer individuals are left alone especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline all in all despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies there are also risks and downsides of using them without face to face communication therefore the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced ,7.0

2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,with the development of technology there is a debate whether advanced communication technology would be a major contributor to worsening human relationships in modern society in my opinion the developing communication tool could have negative impacts on social relationships in the future i hold this opinion for two reasons which i will elaborate on in the following essay to begin with new technology could be out of control at an early phase of introduction new technologies certainly enable us to live conveniently as a result however it often takes some time to fit them into our lifestyles under the control above all the latest tool could bring worsened effects on society than we expect to be more specific bullying with the use of smartphone is one of the major problems all over the world today it is manifest that new communication tools can easily devastate human relationships in this regard on the other hand some arguments can be made that new communication tools make it possible that people across the world can have a chat without physical moving to another place but closer examination would reveal that the introduction of new communication technology also causes fewer opportunities for people to meet up in person a compelling example of this is that japanese people have less relationship with their neighborhood than in the post people living today might be satisfied with tons of telecommunication rather than direct communication i strongly suppose this is also a negative effect on social relationships with the use of new technology having considered all the above i strongly believe that modern communication tools would lead to a negative result for social relationships because of uncontrollable aspects of the latest technology and loss of communication in person with the use of new communication tools ,7.0

2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,some people believe that communication technology advancement leads to social problems i partially agree with this statement social media applications such as instagram and facebook do have a toxic influence on people s relationships but from the other hand communication technology enables people to communicate freely whether a person is physically in china or in america the rapid blooming of social media communication tools has made people s lives easier but there is another side of a coin now individuals are able to create internet pages anonymously this function has blown up people s trust now everybody can create a fake page on the internet and catfish another person without revealing her his personality it is definitely a negative effect on relationships between people in general nevertheless modern communication technology connected so many people for example relatives who are living in different countries can preserve their family connections by communicating through online services and applications this function can help to support relationships of people who are far away from each other moreover there is evidence that people have started to date each other more because of dating applications progress for shy and introverted people this is an important improvement because they can start chatting online and then gradually switch to real life communication to conclude modern communication technology has both benefits and drawbacks the most important drawback is a deterioration of social trust because of the anonymous activity but the benefits of using communication technology outweigh all the drawbacks communication technology gives the possibility to communicate with relatives who are living on another edge of the planet ,7.0

Discuss both views and give your opinion.",there are two possible ways to interprete the significance of history experience for our everyday life the first point is to ignore the history experience the main reason is based on the opinion that history never repeats all historical persons that lived at the elder times never made their decisions in the conditions those surround us the world has changed significantly technology information transport medicine human rights all these important parts of our life has changed since the elder times so we can not directly copy the decisions of different problems of the elder times to our present life the second point is to use the history experience in our present life this opinion is based on observed samples of very similar intervals of history at different time periods in different countries there were some events or historical processes being very similar there are a lot of examples illustrating this thought all countries of medieval europe and asia past through the feodalism period then leaders of that counties decided that the feodalism is not the most effective way to control the country and annuled it nowadays we know that experience and i believe there will be no attempts to buld the feodalism again the second example is the practice of conquestions there were a lot of great conquerrors in the world s history alexander macedonian caesar chinggis khan napoleon gitler all the listed persons conquerred big territories their armies were very strong but some time past and their empires were broken sometimes their enemies united against the conquerrors sometimes they just died and their successors could not save the empires but always the empires died nowadays we have no any signs of old borders of that empires actually all state borders are based on nations borders not on the old conquestions i think the second opinion is better the reason is following there are a lot of institutions in our life that we like for example human rights property rights education medicine all these institutions appeared as a result of historical experince if our predecessors ignored that experience we would never live in the modern society in that case we would have no modern medicine and education also we would live in the society with slaver so i think that we should thoroughly study the historical experience and use its conclusions in our present life ,6.5

Is this a positive or negative development?,money can not buy happiness is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances it is argued that topics around money wealth and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world in my opinion the extream part of it is a negative development although it has some positivities i will address some of both sides in this essay talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like thus might effect on the person s social life moreover having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession and as a result this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction which could lead to depression or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely nevertheless the person should be aware of his her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way also the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often in conclusion people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time however i believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life ,7.0

Is this a positive or negative development?,increasing in interests about money happened in many countries worldwide obviously aguements about wage and income has become popular topics for people this essay will demonstrate reasons behide this and some possible consequences followed the statement to begin in the modern world social media plays a major role in which people younger generation in particular communicate with others this can be a dominant cause leading to daily conversations about financial issues for example a plenty of contents posted on digital platforms such as facebook and instagram are related to financial knowledge this perhaps normalize the topics about financial to be more acceptable than in the past furthermore luxury products have become an indicator of social status for younger generation with tons of advertisements involved in every kinds of medias people tend to spend their wealth on artificial things more and more for instance i experienced with a few individuals saving over a half of their monthly income to be able to purchase a high end watch although having converstions about money might help people to understand deeper about money management and how improve themselves to get higher wage this could lead to overspendings which could have a huge negative effect in conclusion it seems to me that a widely used of social media and advertisements of luxury products are two major causes of a rising in popurlarity of talking about money on one hand the situation can help equip people with better knowledge about money management and self improvement on the other hand daily discussions about money has a potential to raise an importance of external artificial objects ,6.0

2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,in modern society most people believe that money is as important and indispensable as water as a result in many countries people talk more and more about money such as how much they earn or pay for things in everyday conversation this phenomenon i think is a negative development and i have three reasons for this 1 inner hypocrisy 2 lack of confidence in oneself 3 thinking and vision first of all the inner hypocrisy many young people like to talk to their friends about how much they earn and how many expensive things they buy at the college reunion everyone should introduce himself or herself for example what kind of work he or she is doing now recently bought a house and a car somewhere and then has to recommend it to others the core purpose is to say i ve made millions in just a few years and bought a house and a car although they look nice on the outside they are empty inside therefore the inner hypocrisy is because they are empty in their heart and have nothing else to compare with others they can use the money to make up for and satisfy their inner emptiness and only in others can they find their sense of existence recognition and attention to themselves secondly i am not confident in myself many elderly people like to chat about their children while playing cards under the community pavilion for example if your child is married how much does your child earn in a month did your child buy you anything expensive if you answer in the negative you will be looked down upon even saying your children are working such long hours for so little money and they don t buy you anything nice these people often talk about it because they are not confident in themselves and they know that their children are inferior in abilities and other aspects in other words they are uncertain and reckless so they like to show off in front of each other and want to prove themselves and their ability to each other finally the thinking and vision are not high every country or place has different classes of people such as those living in rural china and paternal they all lived in the past on the surface look good in every way but only after material things because they think money is the most important money can do a lot of things and only money can give them a sense of security as can be seen from this a person s circle of friends and living environment can determine a person s thinking and vision so only if your surroundings are positive can attract more positive people like you in a word if a person always talks about money it shows that he is hypocritical inside not confident in himself thinking and vision are not high so be sure to constantly improve your thinking and vision constantly improve your ability in all aspects and even keep positive at all times so that not only can attract more people like you but also your future life will be better ,6.0

2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,it is a face that people love to talk about money such as income and price of things in this modern society in my view there are some reasons in both physical and mental aspects and it will bring about negative effect if it develop deeply money is required when we live in this society while we have limited ability to earn money therefore realistically all of us cannot avoid to count our money when we spend it also in macro view the government also care about it the figure of gpd issues every year for measuring wealth of a country populace pay attention in it not only because of the international state of a country but also because of the welfare of people regarding mental reasons people generally think that the ability of earning money is related to the success of their life moreover people like competition so we always compare our level of income with our friends or companions however i think that this is a negative development when people deeply concentrate in it first i do not agree that money is everything as a human being embodying freedom is the highest value in our live so i believe that accomplishing the mental achievements is more important that physical target otherwise people will become heartless because they think that money is the only criteria for measuring how useful of a human for example we can help and take care of others as volunteers without any payment and turn the topic of conversation from money to life in summary although money is necessary in our daily life it turn us to be ruthless if we cannot control it well so we can do some meaningful events with our friends rather than talking too much about money ,6.5

2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,material achievement has been discussed at a high frequency in some countries people widely involve this topic in every aspect of their lives this essay will give two possible reasons for this phenomenon and explain the negative impacts on society two major causes keep people lingering on this topic firstly the difficulties in earning a living in some countries have significantly drawn people s focus on finance for instance more job opportunities are needed for job seekers in countries with low productivity besides that in many low income countries people have to endure low pay in some extreme cases their earnings can not cover their spending therefore tremendous anxiety cause people from these countries constantly talk about their financial situations on the other side flaunting is becoming the mainstream mindset in some countries commonly in some countries that just escaped poverty the increasing spared money makes showing off possible people in these countries display their wealth by owning luxurious items such as branded bags or jewelry therefore money naturally becomes essential in their conversations although the reasons for money focusing vary it might develop into risky societal factors if the frequent discussion of finance is due to insufficient employment or inadequate wages it is an alarm to the governments to carry on measures of boosting industries development otherwise riots might be expected and harm social safety furthermore this widespread discussion highly leads to material comparison which harms morality and even allows crimes to occur when individuals obsess with showing off they feel the shame of disposing of the downsides to maintain a perfect image especially a wealthy appearance some people even turn to crime such as stealing or robbery to conclude folks popularly discuss money for various reasons such as the demands of work or psychological factors however the phenomenon is not a positive sign to society and most likely indicates the upcoming crisis ,8.5

2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,in recent years in some countries including japan some people believe that governments should cover all tuition fees for students who are willing to study at university although the total cost will be massive and the governments need to increase the tax on citizens i strongly agree with this opinion to begin with it is absolutely unfair for students who need to give up going to university because of a lack of money in japan they need to terminate to pursue their study at university there are many students who study diligently though if the government supported them financially those who terminated their study could have continued studying and had the great job opportunities they hoped for in addition some developed countries have been suffering from depopulation so there are some industries such as it and civil engineering that chronically have a problem with how to improve the shortage of employees if governments encourage students to study these industries at university for free the companies will be not only helpful to increase the number of employees and also effective for students to obtain some qualifications in advance in university this means that the companies do not necessarily spare longer training time than usual for new employees furthermore economic growth is linked inextricably with education if all students could have a variety of courses at university for free charge they will be able to obtain skillful techniques and plenty of knowledge to pursue their career opportunities regardless of age in addition they will be able to study with working at the same time with light hearted such as nighttime courses and weekend courses if they could work and study flexibly they will obtain more creative ideas to improve their work if they are required to pay more tax due to the education fee by governments they are more than happy to pay the tax for themselves and other ambitious students in conclusion the free education system in universities must be advantageous to improve their countries economic growth in the long term ,5.5

2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,regarding the suggestions that governments should offord the tuition subsidies to cover the cost of full classes i could only partially agree due to various drawbacks derived from policies as such to begin with higher educational levels is essential for young individuals in poor families reverse their situation not only for themselves but for their families in this case governments have obligations to ensure the right of them to pursue higher education without the financial concerns for example many university students nowadays have more than one part time jobs since they need to support themselves financially which left no time for them to concentrate on studies on the other hand despite free ethic education could benefit a great number of students in need the huge costs to maintain a functional educational institution should not be overlooked by removing tuition fee in universities completely it could derives various downsides including lower quality of education and slower progresses of local constructions and developments caused by the shortage of budgets take the uk as an example private schools are able to provide more educational materiols and professional educators compared to public schools which have high tendency classes and outdated teaching equipments to summerrise in my perspective the right for students to study in universities is crucial since it could not only cultivates talents who are able to contribute to societies but allows them to bring their families out of poverty however people should not be ignoranced for the negative affects derived from removing tuition fee entirely such as poor quality of teaching therefore i could only partially agree with such opinions ,6.0

2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,this essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities but always under one premise those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully there are countries for example scandinavian countries where their government helps students by giving them specific students loans these loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates it is not for free but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies and in many other european countries university fees are not large so most of the students can access to bachelor studies what it s not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want if we talk in worlwide terms university studies are limited to wealthy people in fact i read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17 of worlds population have university studies there is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries as an example in most countries in europe we have too many university students actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in europe or outside europe furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers waiters or receptionists can t be found there no unemployment in vocational work the opposite happens in non developped countries as university studies have large fees almost nobody can access to them and vocational workers suffer unemployment so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs to summarize i believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university the obstable should be your previous califications education and health as much as a country can hold them should be available for all population poor and wealthy with non differentiation ,5.5

2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,education is an important requirement for students establishing their future thus there is a considerable debate about whether the government should give fully supported payment for university courses to people who want to study at there in my view i partially agree with this statement because this is a beneficial scheme but the selection of scheme participants is required for filtering those who really need this assistance on the one hand it is a definite good plan for those families are low income a completed bachelor s degree course may cost over 10 thousand dollars however some grassroots families are hard to afford it so they may tend to not study at universities but find a job for earning money after that college may lose some potentially intelligent students therefore if this scheme can be implemented successfully those students will show their ingenuity and get higher academic achievement finally giving back to society when they succeed on the other hand this scheme is not suitable for everyone qualification checking is needed for choosing someone who truly aspires to an opportunity to study at college for example setting a line indicating the limit of the monthly income of a family is a way for the government to distinguish who is needed to help because the cost of the study is also a type of inspiration for students studying harder if a family was proven to be able to afford the fees the government would not give assistance to them in order to avoid abusive use in summary although this scheme is advantageous for low income families revealing their children s inherent power the government can set some rules for filtering those who are necessary for help ,7.0

2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,nowadays many people argue that univerties graduation should be sponsouring by governments institution in other to provide this level of education for each one who desires it i disagree with this argument as in my opinion isn t a governments role provide a higher education for the whole society first of all the most important government task is guarantee a better level of basic education so having great public schools to fundamental level enable all students to been accept or get the approval for any univerties and even to requires a schoolarship when it is necessary governments shouldn t spend public money in graduation or higher level education in order to keep all efforts on be the number one in fundamental education another public politic which may shows a good results is provide a specials credit lines for students who haven t enouth money to pay full tuition fees these type of credit might create a sense of responsability and encourage students to loooking for a good job as soon as they ve concluded the course this kind of financial should consider that payment only starts after the end of their course in conclusion i would argue that having the government paying the fees for university studies isn t looks to be a good solution to guarantee an university access for whole population states should keep investing and execute their role to persue the best fundamental public education and might enable their students to get into any university if those student haven t enouth money or condition to pay all fees states only need to provide a special credits to them ,5.5

2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,it is believed that governments ought to pay full institutional fees for students who want to obtain higher education i would say that i strongly agree with this statement to start with the cost of course fees nowadays is much higher than it used to be a decade ago one of the biggest problemss for school leavers is to manage to collect a huge amount of money that is needed in order to enter the university of your dream of course there are some scholarships that are very helpful but the problem is that they are only available for very talented students who scored only high grades during their educational process or for those who come from low income families as the result students who have passion and necessary skills can not afford to study in the university on the ohter hand paying for everyone s course fee would lead to a huge hole in every government s budget the possibility of free studying for everyone sounds naive and kind of impossible another problem is that those students who are more likely not to participate well during their studies and might drop off the university after the first year will have an opportunity to enter universities this will likely lead to problems with whole educational system the only solution is to select wisely whether this or that student is ready to spend his or her time studying new knowledge and skills in conclusion paying for course fees is a good idea but only for those students who have enthusiasm for studying,6.5

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",it is very easy to find someone who smokes in today s society even though we were taught that smoke is harmful we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store this essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated firstly part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke in many pop culture such as songs movies and novels portray smoking possitively a comedy show that i have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool giving this character an untouchable aura whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane furthermore cigarettes are easily accessable in any store a recent study proved that over 80 of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops the trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit i believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable a movie i have seen showed the protagonist s constant need for cigarette throughout the show however in the end when he finally unites with his crush he develops a severe disease mainly from his smoking habits in which he regretted in the end this method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking in addition government should control the accessibility of cigarettes policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people in conclusion although many people knew how harmful smoking is many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy by making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access i believe that smoking will be less attractive hence reducing the number of smokers in society ,7.0

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",nowadays smoking has become very common in many individuals although governments have been trying to prevent people from smoking by displaying many warning advertisements on medias people struggle to stop smoking there many reasons that explain this like the addiction of tabasco the social effect of smoking and the lack of awareness about the effects from people however many ways to reduce smoking on society exist like the promotion of physical activity as well as medical treaments evidence strongly shows that the habit of smoking is triggered by the addictive side of tabasco in fact studies demonstrate that tabasco contain substances that affect areas in the brain which are reponsible of the feeling of pleasure and addiction thus smoking becomes more and more pleasant and addictive moreover smoking is a way of socialization for people in fact many individuals enjoy being gathered and discuss while they smoke a cigaret they find it very relaxing and pleasant so they do not plan to stop it as it allows them to meet new people for example nevertheless i believe that the lack of awareness from people about the negative effects is a major component that explains why people do not want to stop smoking indeed many surveys show that people do not know that smoking has several negative effetcs they know about lungs cancer despite it seems not to afraid them but tooth and throat issues are less known in the vast majority of smokers however many ways exist in order to encourage people to stop smoking in my opinion physical activity and medical treatments are the most effective in fact governments have been investing a lot in the promotion of physical activity by the means of advertising campaigns for instance in the usa surveys show that there is an increase of 20 of people doing physical activity in order to overcome their addiction issues related to smoking moreover medical treatments have been improved over the last years so as to help people to cope with their addiction with smoking and studies show that treatments are becoming more and more effective for instance in france the number of smokers has decreased and medical treatment is the second reason to explain this phenomenon behind physical activity to conclude even though there are many reasons that explain the addictive behaviours of people to keep smoking i believe that there are several ways to improve this situation particularly by the means of physical activity and medical treatments ,8.0

1,"The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.",the diagrams show the way in which the flooding of houses may be prevented by constructing them upon raised foundations so that the floor of the house is separated from the highest probable water level considering a period of 100 years by at least 300 millimeters 30 centimeters this distance is called freeboard the first diagram shows how this may be accomplished in situations in which the house is located between a stopbank that is a barrier separating the river or drain from the area in which the house is located and a hill or otherwise elevated area from which rainwater may run downhill a phenomenon known as internal runoff potentially creating a pond in the area in which the house stands in such a situation the diagram shows that the stopbank should be higher than the 100 year flood level although it does not show the minimum clearance required at the same time the house should be high enough that its floor is at least 300 millimeters above the 100 year ponding level the second diagram shows the way in which the house should be protected from floods in situations where there is no stopbank in such cases the house should simply be raised to a height at least 300 millimeters above the 100 year flood level the second diagram does not show the effects of any internal runoff both diagrams provide for a common solution which is to have a minimum freeboard of 300 millimeters between the bottom of the house and the highest probable water level be it the 100 year flood level or the 100 year ponding level ,8.5
2,Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married i tend to agree with such opinions as i find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable for example it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside people instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off guard when at home whereas in social situations they usually make an effort even if unconsciously to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others even their partners because of this it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person in extreme cases cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness considering this possibility seems reasonable as marriage is not only an emotional bond but also a legal one and undoing it is usually upsetting time consuming and costly another reason i find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following what i have said up to this point reflects my opinion but it must be noted i did not put any of it into practice when i got married indeed my wife and i decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony this decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old fashioned and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them no degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain we found the long term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned ,9.0
1,"The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.",the diagram illustrates the effect of a stopbank in frequently flooded areas overall a stopbank divides the land from the rive or the drain and contributes to the formation of an internal ponding system on land houses can be built lower in areas with a stopbank it is clearly shown in the diagram that house floor level in areas without a stopbank must be 300 millimeters above the 100 year flood or ponding level however house floor level in areas with a stopbank can be much lower even under the 100 year flood level this might result from the fact that the stopbank is high enough to stop water from flooding in at the same time the floodgate and berm under the stopbank connect the internal pond with the river outside when the internal runoff leads to too much water on land people can open the floodgate and let the water out into the river or drain ,8.0

Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,recently many countries have legalized gay marriage however there are many people who do not agree with that and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children and the evolution of society however in my opinion i think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others and have the right to have children despite of their situation to begin there are many parents for example who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex as a result more and more children will become homosexual which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned however i believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal that they will be influenced by this in fact they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that moreover they will be more open minded which is very important for children development secondly many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids as a consequence this phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future however i am not of this opinion i think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world s population in not homosexual moreover by allowing gay marriage gay couples will be able to adopt children indeed due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new born they can adopt children who are abandonned and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions to conclude i firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society indeed not only it makes children more open minded which is important for their own development but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned a safe environment to thrive in ,8.0

Discuss both views.,international sport events such as the olympics and the world cup tend to be the center of attention when they are held while many people believe that being the location of the events can bring tremendous advantages to the host others argue that the preparation does not worth the benefits this essay will examine the opinions of both sides to begin with an international sport tournament leads to an abruptly economic growth as it attracts a large number of sports fans from all around the globe being the destination of these visitors all hotels in the city and neighbouring areas can be fully booked and local businesses surrounding will be in turmoil to serve the tourists for example the olympics usually caused all accommodations around the hosting areas to be occupied and therefore the city can obtain additional income by setting up temporary accommodations nevertheless these opportunities usually come with enormous prices with the foregoing benefits the hosting country needs to put enormous effort into preparation prior to the event to elaborate in order to welcome a countless amount of visitors the country is required to invest in constructing maintenance and improvement of venues and various relevant locations as a certain level of readiness and handling standards are expected from the fans failing to meet the expectations can lead to negative reputations of the country furthermore the hosting country will also have to bear the risks that may impact the event for example if there is any force majeure such as a pandemic the event may be postponed or even cancelled to conclude the occurance of international sports events can bring significant devlopments to the host in an exchange of a great deal of investments and risks thus the government must consider thoroughly before deciding to step in ,6.0

2,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.,certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries while hosting sport events might also entail risks i firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose as i will explain below international sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes staff and tourists this usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors people need to be fed thus activating restaurants economy additionally they need a place to sleep and rest which would benefit hotels on the other hand many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure including stadiums pools public squares and even airports it is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events let us take the example of the city montreal in canada which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country for example it is not a secret that some countries such as germany and russia have used the world cup to improve their international image with positive results overall finally since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term it is important to mention however that hosting sport events might also entail some risks these competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize and middle or low income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure such as hospitals and schools moreover examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption in conclusion there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events these events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors could bring new infrastructure and may trigger development ,7.0

1,The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.,information is presented by two pie charts which compare the average household expenses classified by 6 categories in a particular country between 1950 and 2010 overall it can be clearly seen that housing was the major expenditure in 1950 while in 2010 food became the most popular expense turning to the first main feature in 1950 72 1 of households spent on housing which was the highest ratio whereas there was an exact 22 0 of households in 2010 additionally the second largest proportion of expenditures in 1950 was food amounting to 11 2 the figure for food then increased to a precise 34 0 in 2010 which was the largest percentage with respect to other expenses this category accounted for only 4 4 in 1950 before rising to an exact 19 2 in 2010 turning to another main feature there was an increase in the transportation expense from a mere 3 3 in 1950 to a modest 14 0 in 2010 in terms of health care households spent on this category the least in both years contributing to 2 4 and 4 5 in 1950 and 2010 respectively the last key point to note is education expenditure which decreased slightly from 6 6 in 1950 to 6 3 in 2010 ,6.5

1,The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.,those pie charts give information about average house expenditures during two different periods of time 1950 and 2010 below i will describe both ones in details about what it was like during those two different periods of time first of all we can see that during the year 1950 people used to spend 72 1 from their income to pay for rent and 22 0 in 2010 that means we have seen a great decline comparing those two years together the percentage for food which is 11 2 in 1950 and 34 0 in 2010 mark in a great increase in the recent times the percentage for healthcare during 1950 and 2010 are 2 4 and 4 5 respectively marks in increase giving an idea that people are paying more from their income for healthcare we have seen a huge increase for those two period of times for transportation which is 3 3 and 14 0 for transportation in terms of education for those two years the percentage almost stays the same 6 3 and 6 6 respectively with a little difference between both of them for the last point which is for other things not mentioned here maybe for unexpeted items and other stuff that they might not been buying on a monthly basis we can see the percentage increasing maybe household members spend more on items that can t be counted in a monthly budget ,5.5

1,The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.,the pie charts illustrates how the movement of household has been expanding in a country in the period 1950 and 2010 according to the pie chart in 1950 the housing works has taken the largest percentage among the other services this is apparently refer to the need a lot of spending because the families were bigger than today while the transportation and the others cash is considered much the least between the whole needs in 2010 there is a big change in the whole life style which truly impact on families and their ways of spending money first of all buying food is quite important as original source for people energy it has taken the largest amount in exactly 34 and because many wives become worker the need to buy ready meals become more necessary than before also it is clear that transportation is almost nearly equal as to what has shown there is rapidly decreasing in housing s spending in 2010 and this is justified by the completely change of life in using less and simple thing instead of using expensive and too much staff and also select smaller house rather than bigger ones moreover most families prefer to spend money on their pleasure and joyful life it is noticed that other spending has jumped sharply from 4 to 19 2 which means people are turning to be consumers finally there is no doubt that education has less priority in both dates to sum up we could say that the amount of expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010 has differed according to the lifestyle of each family ,6.5

2,Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,the topic indicated that the family members no longer eat meals together in the modern society the reason are complex and the phenomenon is inevitable i think the first factor is that the pressure from the modern age has increased more and more family members busy on their jobs and studies they undergo more pressures than ever have before for example a father who very busy at work he usually work extra hours and social with his clients his schedule is volatile thus he has to give up his time to eat meals with his family members the second factor is that family members have their own schedules in the fast moving world furthermore the more social activities lead sophisticated to people s lifestyle for example a family member who goes to fitness center after work he eat by individual instead eat meal together the third factor is that the scale of family members has decreased more and more family members left their hometown for the new place like urban or big city they cannot eat together due to geographical separation probably a family member eat meals by individual whom might feel lonely and insulated on conclusion this social phenomenon is an evident of the changing society obviously family member eat meal together that help them to reinforce their relationships each other and create a good communication among them it would be a happiness moment when family members eating together but the fact we have to accept is that the society is changing ,5.5

2,Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,some people argue that people less frequently gather around a table at meals with their family members due to a number of factors such as changing trends in the living style and weakened relations between parents and children i strongly believe that this has a devastating effect on the future of society compared to half of a century ago the habits of especially big city dwellers have experienced a dramatic shift in recent years while people get used to living in extended families today they tend to live in smaller families called celullar families in the following step isolation became much more significant that children aged over 18 years prefer to move to a separate house additionally even individuals who live with their family rarely share daily activities including eating meals mainly related to different and busy working schedules apparently the residents of the metropolis are reluctant to spend their time because of the increased incidence of depression or other psychologic disorders a growing body of evidence indicates that as people choose to do their activities alone their family bonds are also negatively affected as a physician from my point of view children who are raised in this environment are more likely to become antisocial and unsuccessful in both academic and social life furthermore most of these young persons suffer from psychiatric disorders which are remarkably infrequent among people who keep in touch with their relatives also these youngsters are more commonly committed crimes such as drug trafficking robbery or even murder in conclusion quitting daily activities that are done together is the initial step of falling apart for family members which inevitably leads to worse outcomes for the society like increased risk of crime and psychiatric problems ,6.5
1,The diagram below shows how ethanol fuel is produced from corn.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.,the diagram shown provides information about how corn is transformed to ethanol fuel overall it is a simple and short process that consist on 7 steps in just one of these water is added to begin with corn is recolected and storaged afterwards it is millied the next step it is really important while it is being cooking the water is added this part takes four hours following the mixed corn and water are left to fermentation for another 48 hours then another critic step is made the separating process when liquid is extracted and solid by product is eliminated the remanent of this is purified to ethanol and it takes five hours finally it is stored and transported to different locations in conclusion the process to obtain purified ethanol from corn is relative easy it takes just 7 steps previous transportation in just one step water is added and two steps later it is taken out the whole process takes about 3 days 4 hours of cooking 48 hours to ferment and 5 hours to purify the ethanol ,6.0

1,The diagram below shows how ethanol fuel is produced from corn.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.,ethanol fuel is produced from corn a popular grain grown in most parts of the world including south america and africa the process of producing ethanol fuel starts with storing corn in large barns made out of plastic and wood this is to prevent moisture from damaging it from these large barns corn is taken to a milling plant where it is cooked for 4 hours during the cooking process water is maintained at a certain level to ensure that the corn is always submerged in water while boiling the cooked corn is then fermented for at least 48 hours this is to prepare it for separation of solid by products and the liquid drawn from the cooked and fermented corn the solid by product is dried to be used for other products like chuka a cornflake like snack eaten by children however the liquid is further purified into ethanol the prosess of purifying the liquid into ethanol takes about 5 hours purified ethanol is stored in large containers and sealed for safety purposes the last part of the process of ethanol fuel processing is transportation ethanol fuel can be transported by rail road or sea to different destinations where it is used ,7.0

2,The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,the use of social media nowadays is widespread around the world as the use of new techonology grows people concern about what will be impact of this change some people argue the use of social media is replacing face to face interaction among people which will lead to negative impacts on the society whereas others claim that the benefits from the use of social media outweigh the negative impacts which one is true i will compare these two perspectives and state my opinion in this essay there is no denying that the use of social media is replacing face to face interaction to some extent people use social media to connect with other people this kind of behaviors decrease the aspiration of real life interaction however using social media can not give the same feeling as a face to face interation there is lack of intimacy and empathy for this reason it is easy to fall in lonelyness while occupied in social media however sometimes the use of social media assists the interactions in real life for example friends who are far away from each other can interact in social medias this helps to keep their relationship which can lead to a face to face interaction in the future moreover some people even find out their lover through social medias in my opinion the argument that the use of social media will replace face to face interaction is a little bit exaggerated after all most people use social media to assist their real life relationship not to completely replace their face to face interactions with online chattings the use of social media might replace some portion of face to face interaction but in most cases it will help us to connect with other people and promote our real life interactions ,6.0

2,The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,the modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media messengers for private or corporate messaging we also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely as for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain on the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information on the other hand communication gives some non verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process belonging to a circle of friends collegues or family these two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that s why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies if to talk about an information exchange as for it became much more efficient with using messages cloud storages and different coworking tools but it is true only for those people who use these technology well as far as i can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting offices and separate equipment many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties some people couldn t concentrate while working at home as for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face to face interraction and being managed by their boss at the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are one another need is to have a social interraction of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances while moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore it allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger at the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face to face communication with people phisically close to them as for me it gives only one disadvantage it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face to face interraction i can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones at the same time modern technologies blur boundaries between a real conversation and internet communication now we can perfectly see and hear each other and even support financially there are also some devises wich allow you to feel even more like touches or heartrythm of each other i think that new social media tools and some next directions of these tools will satisfy our face to face communication needs more and more over time ,5.0

1,The line graph below shows the oil production and consumption in China between 1982 and 2006.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.,this line graph illustrate the comparison between the oil that was produced and consumpted in china from 1982 to 2006 the data is given in millions of oil barriels per day the first thing to note is how consumption has surpassed by far the production levels even though at first both started at a similar point on one side consumption remained at a very low growth from 1982 until 1990 barely crossing the 2 million of oil barrels threeshold from that point on it skyrocketed surpassing consumption in less than 4 years although in 1994 the tendency slowed down on the other hand production experienced an increase from 1982 to 1986 but then leveled off at 3 million oil barrels since then there hasn t been any remarkable change only a small positive trend starting in 1994 that hasn t stopped yet overall it can be said that in a span of 24 years consumption has almost doubled the production data ,6.5
2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,many people argue that individuals can t do nothing to resolve the environmental problems of our times personaly i partially disagree with this statement and in this essay i will go through some of the arguments that back my opinion on one hand i have to agree with this statement many of the environmental problems that we are currently facing are caused by large companies and not by individuals whether it s pollution deforestation or contamination the indivual doesn t have as much impact as these entities have therefore governements should take care of the problem rather than passing into the current citizen in addition the solutions that are needed to take place require an important political and economical influence only the governments are available to put in place the measures needed to counter balance this situation on the other hand waiting to be saved by the governments and institutions is not the right attitude individuals while not having the same impact can spark the change that is needed in order to take care of this problem not only that but citizens can make their contribution by applying some small measures than by itselfs aren t noticeable but when summed up can have a positive impact for example recycling their food waste or using ecological friendly products are habits that we can all do if only one person does it it won t have any effect but it does when it s done by one million in conclusion it can be said that both sides are needed in order to make a positive change on the current situation this can start from the individual to then put in motion a bigger change ,7.0

2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,individuals who are willing to develop the environment are quite limited some people say it is almost nothing they can do therefore governments and large companies need to improve the environment and it must be a large impact for society i strongly disagree this opinion because individuals also make a difference for the environment to some extent initially there is no doubt that governments large companies and organizations have a large initiative to change the environment for example in europe especially in germany they are planning to make some restrictions on car industries not to manufacture cars which consume only petrol as energy in near future therefore even in some sports car companies started releasing a new type of car which take advantage of electricity which is a sustainable resource therefore governments and companies control peoples lifestyle on the other hand people have already become aware of dangerous environment they are on the line therefore many people voluntarily started to pick up garbage on the street and seaside they also purchase sustainable bottles instead of tapping into plastic bottles in addition technology has advanced in a few decades and some influencers on the internet warn about issues of the environment this means that individuals regardless of generation start to make some communities on social media and hold some events for example they discuss what they can do in their daily routine to reduce the consumerism and which materials are realistically sustainable stuff in our lifestyle as a result some people start to establish a company geared towards eco friendly company for example some companies launched the project to manufacture the solar panel and make strategies on how to spread them around the world as a sustainable and renewable resource finally of course large companies and governments have a large power to control the environment more beautifully on the other hand these organizations also configured by individuals therefore governments need to add an environment subject in the curriculum at school consequently more people start to consider on how to improve the environment in a large organization the more people will suggest and make specific plans individually if the ideas were rejected they can post these ideas on the internet and people will come together to make a specific project in conclusion individuals can do a lot of options by taking advantage of the internet and the influences are getting larger ,6.5
1,The line graph below shows the oil production and consumption in China between 1982 and 2006.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.,this line graph illustrates the both production and consumption of oil barrels in china between 1982 till 2006 it is clear from the line graph that the oil number grow over the years with a significant escalation of oil barrels demands according to what is shown both production and consumption in 1982 are the same amounts with 2 million barrels per day firstly the production is moderately raised to 3 million in 1986 then they remained in the same quantities till 1994 then slowly grow to 3 5 million barrels till 2006 secondly meanwhile consumption was stable from 1982 to 1990 with only 2 million barrels however the number increased almost double in the year 1994 consequently since 1994 the relationship between the oil demands and supply began to change differently due to a dramatic increase in oil consumption compared with production overall we could analyze that both production and consumption broke even in the year 1992 however till the year 2006 the consumption of oil barrels has been doubled to more than 6 million barrels while the production remained the same as from the year 1998 ,7.0
2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,there is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact i strongly disagree with this idea because there are other ways to help the government as an individual in essay will prove my point with reasons and examples nowadays people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave therefore an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve for example social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better for instance show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way moreover as individuals people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions on the other hand the government and companies should be aware too for example while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule in conclusion after carefully explaining my points of view in my opinion it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation ,7.0

2,"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",it is no doubt the truth that the majority of people want to live in a society where they can derive a sense of satisfaction while people are ceaselessly struggling to improve society to meet their needs there is almost always some problems or issues that remain and keep society from being better in this essay i try to examine the reason why it is a highly challenging and even impossible task to create an ideal society and give some measures that might be helpful to mitigate the situation the first step is to understand why the goal of an ideal society is tough to achieve one of the most apparent reasons is that it is nearly not possible to give an explicit definition of ideality since the desire of each person can be extremely different and individual their expectations of what an excellent society should look like are immensely varied and sometimes incompatible with each other for instance some people wish to have a society of fewer foreign immigrants because of the eventual rise in crime and the more intensive competitiveness in the job market while others insist that a multicultural society certainly brings vast amounts of merits to the future another obvious reason is in terms of the difficulty of realizing the requirements a prime example is eliminating discrimination against gender or sexual orientation although a lot of related laws have been introduced to protect the vulnerable population from being discriminated against this issue remains one of the most significant concerns that people have and need to face every day despite the complexity and challenges of creating the ideal society for everyone there is still a large number of things that can be done to enhance the expectations of people toward the society where they live in my opinion an ideal society includes at least great tolerance i believe that education especially in primary school and kindergarten plays an essential role in teaching how to treat others with respect which benefits the tolerant atmosphere in society significantly one measure that government should leastwise take into account is to fund the more meaningful projects at the school which publicize and advocate the value of fairness justice and kindness to sum up although it might not be possible to create a society that satisfies the whole population regarding the huge diversity of attitudes people hold toward the key consideration of an ideal society there is still highly necessary to make every effort to make it a better one for all ,8.0

What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,the topic of whether students should choose a specific specialized in limited subjects or all students need to study a wide range of subjects until they graduate school has been discussed across the world including in japan although there are some benefits to the education system which specialize in some specific subject i think to learn wide range of subjects until they leave school for example there are some courses which focus on some specific industry in japan specifically it is geared toward hair stylists it programming and entertainment it is useful for them to learn the specific curriculums earlier might be advantageous to master these techniques especially when it comes to entertainment younger talented people tend to be evaluated higher than older talented people on the other hand there are some benefits to learn a variety of subjects until they leave high school for example learning mathematics will allow us to boost some skills to predict and solve some issues logically and learning english will be an essential tool to communicate with people worldwide in addition people have often required a variety of educational knowledge in daily conversation especially in the workplace this means that learning a wide range of subjects is helpful to bear out their variety of educational backgrounds finally it might be difficult for teenagers especially fifteen years old students to decide which occupation and industry they would like to work teenagers have often deluded and changed their idea about which occupation is suitable for them however they have some specific dreams in advance therefore learning a wide range of subjects will be helpful to decide a variety of occupations in the future this means that if students had learned a wide range of subjects until high school it will be helpful to consider a long time and let them decide on a variety of job occupations then they should choose the specific faculty they would like to learn at university ,6.0

2,Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,education programs are different from one area to another area there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15 while other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school there are many positives for both trends in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better on the one hand it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study for example when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum as a result all the student s focus will be on medical topics thus the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation furthermore this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age moreover in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians on the other hand it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects since students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics physics medicine and ect therefore those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future besides wide range system help to improve social interactions better because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded to sum up educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students but in my opinion it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like solid academic background in specific field creativity and less financial burden on parents ,7.0

2,Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,the is a common belief that students focus on selected subjects from secondary school is beneficial for their school results however it is a more persuasive argument that students studying a wide range of subjects throughout their school life is more applicable for their future on the one hand studying a limited range of subjects from 15 years ago helps students to develop specific abilities once they decide on their stream of subjects such as art science or commerce they will be focused on special training this teaching method can help them to become a specialist or professionals for instance in china over 500 business schools are opened to train students to become specialists in the business field students can apply to those schools when they turn 15 according to a statistic from one of the business schools 70 of their students received high scores in the national exam nevertheless a wide range of subjects is more suitable for students to develop their intelligence students can student various knowledge from different aspects they can choose the subject they are interested in most moreover students can have a longer time to study before choosing their faculty at university numbers of basic knowledge and longer time to consider helping them make the best decision for themself students are motivated to do their best for example over 90 of students at the norway university claimed that they are satisfied with studying all subjects before choosing a university they have a full idea of what they like and dislike they found that school life is excited and full of happiness to sum up it is apparent that students can be well developed in a specific subject with a limited range of choices however it is undeniable that a wide range of subject can develop their real interests ,6.5

2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,councils are debating if building housing areas on expanded land is a better solution than providing taller dwellings it might be an extremely complicated choice considering the skyrocketing rise of number of people in the world and the change in prefering a walk distance city this essay will explore the optimal solutions for cities layout although the ideal solution might depend on what the cities are aiming for under a generic point of view it would be optimal to have dwellings compacted in a dimished size of land the first justification is that cramping everything in a reduced area and growing tall allowes all the residents to reach shops and workplaces in dwindling time through walking public transport or eco friendly vehicles moreover taking in account the overall incresing of population s density with the creation of a taller layout a sustainable market demand will be shown nowadays the antiquated method of construct residences on a wider area of land is not feasible in most locations cities are running out of vacant lands in fact many single houses are occupying vast areas for luxury amenities for a limited family when a building can be erected accomodating many households furthermore an implementation in infrustracture such as roads and parking will be needed if individuals are not able to arrive to destination without a private car due to long distances to cover more highway will be required therefore more lands is taken away for agglomerate of dwellings and business offices to conclude the world is shifting toward a highly populated areas so that councils need to keep up to date with convinient cities layout like skyscrapers rather than single houses to ease people lifestyles and reduced citizens footprint ,6.5

What solution is better?,some big cities especially in tokyo osaka and yokohama in japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider this is quite understandable in terms of space and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around japan initially the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job there are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries therefore more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space there seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated but infrastructures are well organized especially transport medical care and security in contrast the population in the countryside becomes less therefore there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area it seems to be well relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow paced lifestyle but it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job and lacking transport so they need to rely on cars in addition the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities these issues are long controversial as a first world problem finally as covid 19 spread worldwide many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer innumerable companies adopted it systems that are able to work remotely in addition some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change however covid 19 completely ended this means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities therefore if the transport system is well organized especially establishing and improving a train which works faster and more frequently this effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides in conclusion as a result the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside as a result some issues will be resolved and become well balanced solutions finally it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now ,5.5
1,"The chart below gives information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.",the chart shows that north america has the highest global wealth rate which is almost 35 percent but only has a little higher than a 5 percent of the global population the rich asia pacefic area also has high global wealth with almost 25 percent but a small population of people which is 5 percent of global population in europe the global wealth rate is about 30 percent but the population is around 15 percent which comparing with regions that have similiar population the wealth rate are much higher on the other hand china other asia pacific areas india and africa has extreme low wealth compare to north america rich asia pacefic areas and europe but the population among those area are much higher the information in the chart shows that most of the regions with higher population has lower global wealth rate and the lower population countries are wealthier this indicates the unequalize of global wealth and economy ,5.5
2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,in my opinion the two solutions both have its pros and cons but i think the first solution which is create housing areas by providing taller buildings is a better solution providing taller buildings can save the area of lands being use and can create more areas with green grass or trees that can help the environment also taller buildings can provide greater view and can be designed in creative ways so does the buildings in cities can create a skyline which makes the city scenario more modern and breathtaking on the other hand if we choose to build houses on a wider area the land will still be eventually out of use and they are likely to destroy wildlife or nature areas since places that has wide areas are mostly at the rural parts of the country also houses wide spread in a large area can be crowded and can seem messy and not ideal for site although maybe some people will think that shorter buildings are safer when there is a fire or when natural disasters like earthquake comes but the number of times these problems occur are low and modern technology can also help to lower the risk of people getting hurt in conclusion i think create housing areas by providing taller buildings is a better solution because it solves the fundamental problem which is not having enough places for people to live by not using new lands and can also creates less harm for the nature which is significantly important ,5.5

2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,in the modern society it is seen that the buildings in the housing areas vary from one city to the other city where some cities prefer taller buildings and other cities prefer smaller buildings on a wide land this essay illustrates the reason why they are built in this way and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each type of building it is often said that the taller buildings are ideal for houses in metropolitan cities the main reasons are the cost of land and a very large population in big cities as a solution for this problem people in big cities prefer taller buildings where the homes are easily affordable for them however this leads to over crowding and lack of adequate ventilation for instance in mumbai the largest city in india the cost of land and the population is so high that the majority of the constuction companies build taller buildings in order to solve this problem in contrast some cities with a lower population and comparatively lower cost of land build shorter buildings on a wide land this enables cities to prevent over crowding in communities and have a wider open area with greenery providing a lot of ventilation helping people to lead a better life style for example in chandigarh a union territory in india the construction of houses are perfectly executed providing enough space between each house as the cost of land and the population is relatively low when compared to cities like mumbai to summarise some cities with high cost of land and the high population prefer taller buildings lacking adequate ventilation and leading to overcrowding where as the in the cities with the opposite situation the houses are built on a larger piece of land providing adequate space between each house ,8.5
1,The diagram below shows how rain water is collected and then treated to be used as drinking water in an Australian town. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,the rain water is collected and goes through an underground water filtering system the rain water is first collected at the side of the house and goes through a drain which connects with the underground water filter after the water is filtered they will be keep in the storage then they will be send for water treatment where chemicals are added after that the water is back to the house for drinking the water filter at the beginning briefly filtered the big particals such as dirt or some objects that can be seen with bare eyes and the storage after that is to wait for sedimentation of other big particals on the other hand going through water treatment which is the last step of making drinking water mainly cleans minor particals or molecules in the rain water and the chemicals are added to kill germs or bacterias that might harm human bodies after all these cleaning the dirty rain water can be safe for human to drink ,5.0
2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",i strongly agree with this statement if women and men are both working full time they should share household works first of all if women and men are working full time and they are working in the same amount of time logically the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e however if one of them work for longer hours the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works second of all everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house makes the house dirty creates dirty clothes and dishes if there is only either women or men doing household works it is not fair at all because they both work full time but as i mentioned before the amount of time doing household works can be arranged it doesn t have to be evenly shared for instance if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work the man should help and do her part of household works and when the man are working more the woman should do the same this does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations in conclusion when women and men are both doing full time jobs they should share household works but it doesn t have to to be split in two halves it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations in this way the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works ,5.5

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,the shown diagram illustrates information about the process of collection and filtration of rain water in an austrailian town the process starts after the rain drops slip at the roof of the houses and then enter the pipes which is connected to the under ground system for water treatment as these drops flow in the drain they directly move towards the water filter after the filtering process ends water is then passed to a storage where it can be stored and then transfered to the next procedure when the water slides from the storage and moves to the water treatment tank a small device at the top of the tank produces chemicals in order to clear the water from any additional wastes or bacteria that the water filter was not able to clear before finally the loop ends when the water is treated and moves back to the pipes which is the connection between the water treatment system and the houses people can now have a drinkable water in different sections in their homes to sum up the process of producing a filtering water starts with the pipes that collects the rain water and also ends with pipes that delivers the drinking water after it passed all the treatment procedures within the under ground system ,7.0
2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",it is becoming a trend now that husbands and wives should handle the household works together since both members of the family are working full time in my opinion it is convincing that the house tasks should be equally spread between both genders for the following reasons in many developing countries people are required to work more than before as a result both genders are having busy lives nowadays and cannot handle the works of the house by only one of them if the chores are being handled by both men and women it increases the other partner s satisfaction and shows responsibilty for instance if a wife has several tasks in the kitchen to finish before heading to work and her husband helped their children to get ready for school this emotionally affects the wife and she will eventually feel gratification secondly as technology evolves people are having a hard time to manage the tasks of their homes and might eventually hire a nanny to take care of the children and home as a result children would feel loneliness in addition to being ignored by their parents although it is not easy to manage the work life and family at the same time giving priority to one before the other can be counter productive finally as both partners work together to handle household work it will eventually lead to a balanced life their daily schedules will be organised moreover they will have more time to spend with their children thus the home will not have problems as long as the mother and the father are working together to manage their home by way of conclusion i would like to re affirm there is a vital role for both males and females in order to keep their homes well balanced despite having a full employement job for both of them it is necessary to share the works of their home together ,7.0

2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",it is believed that in several nations ladies and gentlemen should help each other in domestic duties owned to the fact that both are fully employed personally i strongly consent the view due to the fact that none of them is superior to other this essay will explore the foremost motives reflecting this and provide evidence to prove the arguments there are manifold reasons for home activities division first and foremost equality of gender in modern socities either ladies nor men is better than other for this reason once both are integral workers they should divide domestic activities moreover the one who come first at home should task without any prejudice let s take the couple ronaldo although they are famous one as well as wealthy personalities they help each other in meals cooking hence the couple is happy and stable other reason for household sharing activities is in light of women empowering in the contemporary times mandams should be treated equally as sirs so that society could be free of chauvinism for instance in a number of african regions girls still regarded as inferior by their husbands as a result human rights are constantly violated which undoubtedly undermine their live s style and personality in conclusion couple of genders should obviously share the household occupations because both have the same rights as well as occupations therefore i strongly agree with the stand that both can do the dishes without any hesitation furthermore they should make a week blueprint to the best duties management ,6.0

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,the diagram illustrates the process of drinking water production from rainwater in a town in australia overall there are five steps involved in producing drinking water for domestic purposes starting with rainwater collection and ending with drinking water being ready for consumption first rainwater is collected in a tank which is attached next to houses this collected water then passes through a drain down to the water filter under the ground where it is purified afterwards such cleaned water travels passing to a large storage tank set up at the lower level before being sent to a water treatment station at this point such cleaned water is treated by some chemicals added from the top of the container once it has been processed drinking water passes along a pipe back to the aboveground level where it is then consumed by households after being used wastewater passes through the pipe underneath houses to the water filter tank and is combined with rainwater to start the process again ,7.5
2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",in many parts of the world both men and women are full time employees which has led to the trend of shared household chores for both genders in my opinion this shift should be encouraged to reduce inequality issues while it also benefits family relationship first sharing housework is reasonable because it will enhance gender equality which is a worrying problem in many societies in the past it was widely believed that women were solely responsible for household works since women have the distinctive characteristics of care and neatness this has resulted in many women in many countries particularly in asia under pressure and engendering a sense of resentment regarding overwhelming housework if such jobs are shared to men it is highly that such burdens are minimised thus being treated more fairly another compelling reason for having both males and females engaging in doing household chores is the reduction in a family dispute if such duties are mainly done by only men or women the other tends to feel overwhelmed which might in turn lead to domestic argument and violence a clear explanation is a higher rate of divorce in america which is caused by the unnecessary argument made by young adult couples in conclusion while more men and women seem to work full time nowadays it is advisable that they both should take responsibility for doing housework i agree with this as believe that it is fair and will help minimise arguments among family members leading to an equality society and a healthy family unit ,7.5
1,The pie charts below show the percentage of housing owned and rented in the UK in 1991 and 2007.Summarize the information by describing the main features of the charts and making comparisons where appropriate.,the diagrams illustrate the proportions of four different kinds of housing in the uk between 1991 and 2007 namely home owner social renting private renting as well as social housing overall it is clear that the number of homes in uk recorded a considerable increase from 1991 to 2007 at 22 million homes compared to 27 million homes furthermore more uk residents owened their home while less people chose social renting and social housing during the period from 1991 to 2007 looking into the details home owner is the top choice for uk residents which comprised 60 in 1991 then it considerably rose to 70 after 16 years next came to the social renting which recorded an dramatic decrease from 1991 to 2007 at 23 and 17 in turn the percentage of social housing also significantly plunged from 6 to 2 the percentage of private renting remain unchanged at 11 over the period ,7.5
2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,striving for own career development is most of the people s lifetime target in the modern city in some nations employees spend long time at work becomes a phenomenon this essay is going yo discuss the reasons behind and i reckon that this is a negative development for both the companies and employees there are two main reasons behind this phenomenon firstly it could be the corporate culture of the company the management members of the company may agree that workers spending a long period of time in the office equals to excellent performance for instance employees in japanese company could get a greater annual bonus or better chance to promote if they are eager to work for a long hours this forces the employees to to show up in the office just because of giving a good impression to the boss secondly as the competition between different companies in the market is nervous coporate sectors are willing to push their colleagues to enhance their sales or performance it causes a great pressure to the employees whom need to work for long hours to fuifill the expectation from the managements for example product sales agents performance depends on the sales number quarterly if the agent cannot sale the products effectively they will receive less revenues or even being sacked as per the reasons stated i absolutely think that it is a negative development for both the employees and companies it is because it gives the unnecessary pressure to the colleagues which will affect their mental health inversely it downgrades the performance of the employee as well as the company work life balance is important to everyone as suitable relaxing time can considerably enhance the performance of human ,7.5

2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,nowadays many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working there are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which i will discuss in this essay in terms of consequences i personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development it is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours a classic example is the dynamic working condition there are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients need such client may decide to use the service from other competitors hence the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients another common criticism is a bright career path when the employees work for a long period they can carefully check their works and as a result delivery the works with less mistakes doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return with a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours there are many vital drawbacks an obvious effect is the increase in illness people who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work therefore they may not have enough time to do exercises weakening the immune system of their body furthermore with the rise in the amount of working hours people tend to lack social skills this is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments in conclusion it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which in my opinion leads to negative development for themselves this is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life ,7.0

2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,in some countries including japan people tend to spend long hours at work in recent years this issue is often discussed around japan although some japanese people take it positively i strongly oppose this idea and believe it is no longer positive development now i would like to state some reasons with some examples in japanese society firstly the japanese economy used to be the worst poverty country around the world after world war two many buildings and companies were devastated therefore japanese people stucked together on how to recover the damage and improve their economy as a result the japanese economy has drastically and steadily developed as a result the japanese economy was about to be the wealthiest country by 1980 in these periods from 1950 to 1990 the longer people work the more money returned to employees in addition it was traditionally believed for japanese people that it is virtue to work long hours in japanese society but the economic bubble suddenly exploded in 1992 japanese economy suddenly declined and economic growth still remains the same in 2022 sadly working long hours is not necessarily connected to companies profit although it is because of economic recession companies still believed that it is important to work hours will result in increase company s profit as a result some people became workaholics and the number of people who are suffering from mental depression currently japan is one of the highest suicide rates in developed countries finally in my opinion the most important point is how productive systems companies and organizations need to create for example many companies tend to rely on too much tasks for employees who have better skills or positions than other employees therefore they need to provide some curriculums about specific skills in it language and accountant if each employee upskilled their ability it would be able to divide and conquer the tasks more efficiently in addition it must be more effective to adopt intern ship work opportunities for university students this means that those who already have work experience beforehand will cause to reduce their training time in conclusion japanese society is suffering from depopulation too this means that japanese people are required to work with less volume workforce therefore companies and the government need to consider how to work efficiently and reduce too much tasks in one employee i believe japanese people will be able to resolve this problem because they are so diligent and made many success to make a countermeasure by a long history ,6.5

2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,it is often the arguement and debate of the main reasons for why employees spend longer hours at their jobs and what are the consequences of it this essay will argue this statement provide top reasons and main outcomes of doing so and give some relevant examples there are several reasons why workers tend to spend too much time at their jobs beyond the work hours stated in the contracts one reason could be that those employees have recently joined the company and they want to leave a good impression on their supervisors during the three month probation period another factor is related to the many various tasks and projects given all at once hence they get stressed out as they re restricted with the deadlines on the other hand some are just staying at work for a prolonged period is for the sake of self development e g studying for some certification programs online master degree etc when it comes to the consequences it can be either positive or negative depending on the reason itself if it is self development then it is a good thing in contrast if this keeps repeating everyday then it is unhealthy for both the body and the mentality also it can affect the social life and a marriage relationship as an illustration some countries such as dubai have reduced the work hours and the outcome of this study was found satisfactory i g the employees have become more productive fruitful and the quality of their inputs drastically improved to sum up the best and optimal choice is to balance between the social life and the time spent at work if we constantly adopt such habit this will affect our health physically and mentally and as a result the contribution and performance will deteriorate and the required job won t be done at a satisfactory level ,6.0

2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,in recent times as technology progresses majority of people have spent longer time at work for many reasons which can be caused by a high work demands and people need to cope with their daily living this development would have negative connotations if people would not have a work life balance and gradually affect their health numerous workers have sometimes oblige to stay at work longer firstly there are huge companies that need more workforce and time to keep up with work requirements as an individual worker sometimes requires to extend their work hours to finish the workload and assigned tasks in most shipping companies or factories in the philippines for instance there often have an outrageous number of workload to be done therefore multitude employees have been tied up to work and forced to render overtime secondly nowadays people are facing in large of debts and bills in canada the cost of living is quite high and unaffordable for some so that several people work double jobs or often do overtime to earn extra more spending too much hours working has two possible drawbacks an absence or lack of work life balance and acquiring diseases in the long run for married people family time is significantly valuable in order to maintain a good family bond workaholic people have the tendency to negelct the importance of family bonding and tend to experience health problems thereafter according to one research in the us found that the number of workaholic people was tripled from 10 million to about 30 million in over a decade and majority of these people suffered from stress related diseases such as depression heart disease and chronic back pain to conclude most people have spent longer time working due to extreme work demands and personal financial challenges although this gives some benefits to oneself or companies it can turn one s life into unhappy and unhealthy life ,7.0

2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,some people strongly argue that money has to be shared for other ways in contrast it is necessary to invest money for developing the technology for space exploration although there are some benefits to spend money for space exploration i believe the money should be spent for a disparity of wealth and environment initially developing the technology for space exploration is necessary to some extent for example if people found a drastically innovative resource on another planet that takes the place of current resources specifically fossil fuel and wood people do not need to take care of limited resources on the earth any more in addition improving technology will cause to people s convenience on earth as a result for example recently some scientists are planning to launch a space rocket as a transport system on earth hat it takes only two hours between new york and shanghai by rocket on the other hand there are a lot of problems on earth especially in developing countries people are suffering from poverty while in developed countries waste massive food in addition even in developed countries the disparity of wealth has been widening therefore the money which is spent on space exploration should be used for all people s lives more safely around the world developed countries must have many options to give a hand to developing countries for example it must be effective to provide infrastructure agriculture and sharing clothing and food that are about to dispose of in developed countries finally including my opinion people can not choose their own nationality this means that people who were born in a developing country and need to be suffered from poverty are definitely unfair therefore the money is spent on space exploration partially spend for developing countries as a result the disparity of wealth will not be wider and people will be able to live with the same quality of lifestyle as developed countries to some extent ,7.0

2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,these days the space exploration is not just an imagination since human beings landed and step their foot on the moon decades ago in addition the fast technology evolution in the present came from the concerns of many scientists around the world some people believe that focusing on the space evolution matter while others argue that they should invest inside the country in my opinion the exploration of our planet could enhance people s lives in many different ways however the human organization should do the best in other more useful sectors to improve human needs on one hand the space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over recent years scientists researching to find out and trying to know what is hiding out of the black hole and another universal plant if it is livable or has any natural resources for example in 1991 research proved that to travel from the earth to the nearest planet it could take approximately 3 to 4 months continually in other words exploration of a planet is costly as well as takes much time to reach it on the other hand the benefit of universe exploration may change our earth s environment and improve our lives for the next coming generation in technology for instance people after the year 2000 had better communication with each other which was not even possible at any time ever moreover the government invests to develop space exploration companies in conclusion after carefully explaining my points of view i strongly believe that space companies such as spacex must try to find a new resources to visit other planets however i agree that they should be done after providing the basic needs of the human on earth and investing to solve poverty and any other human tragedies ,6.5

To what extend do you agree or disagree?,space so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues due to this curiosity the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big developing technology for it is expensive but in my humble opinion completly justified firstly developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe if with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent secondly space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism space tourism the ceos of some of the most profitable business in america are investigating this possibility the leading enterprises in this sector are blue origin from jeff bezos and space x from elon musk when discovered the way of sending people to space safely space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration in a nutshell space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race furthermore if this was not enough all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue from my point of view even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money our future lies on space so be must spend as much money as possible ,7.0

2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,space exploration has no longer been a si fi fantasy since human beings placed their first steps on the moon in 1950s however rapid evolution of technologies and the fast consumption of natural resources are also major concerns for many scientists in today s world some people believe that more money spent on space exploration is inevitable for fulfulling the demands of scientific discovery and the future development of human technologies however many others argue that this money should be invested in other more useful places where more human lives can be improved space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over the recent years scientists have long been searching for possible ways to contact the unknown lives outside this planet and unwrap the secrets of the universe such as the black holes and the birth of the space the more advanced human technologies become the further an austronaut can travel to scientists believe that space discoveries can help human beings to develop new technologies and find new resources outside our solar system however the evolutions of technologies and equipments always require huge investments in fact space exploration can be both benefitial and time consuming if such a scientific project is carried and supervised by a rich nation greater success can be seen however there are many other pre existing problems on the other side of this planet that require attention and aids such as hunger and proverty in this case i think these issues should be prioritized because every human life is precious if those people s lives are taken care off there should be less worries on scientific research as well in conclusion space exploration can be benefitial for the evolution of human technologies and possible findings of new resources however they should be done after fulfilling the basic needs other people on the other side of this planet ,7.5

2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,some governments budget a considerable amount of expenditure on space exaploration yet many opponents voice their opinion that it is meaningless to financially support this aspect and this money should be alternatively allotted on other more important priorities my firm conviction is that it is rewarding to pour money into exploring outer space since it might produce long term benefits from a short term pespective there are seemingly compelling reasons to exclude space exploration from the national budget the result of exploring the exterrestrial space is unpredictable if research fails it would be a loss of financial resources considering the huge cost besides compared with space exploration education inequality health care problems and underdeveloped infrastuctures are more urgent issues meaning that money spent on these facets may produce immediate benefits for people s quality of life however i firmly believe we should hold a long term perspective and figure out potential merits brought about by exploring and researching the outer space first of all environmental problems such as global warming and water shortage are gradually worsening and threatening people s health to a large extent allocating financial resources on space exploration could further investigate and prove whether there are life forms or natural resources on another planet which might provide a soultion to those long exisiting environmental issues also many exisiting technologies closely associated with the daily life of mainkind such as weather forcast and earthquake anticipation are also highly reliant on the space technology this will allow humans to take necessary precautions in the face of some urgent situations to summarize i believe space exploration is a long term solution to many existing problems on this planet and thus deserve adaquate government expenditure ,8.0

2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,for years space has fascinated humans the idea that there could be life on other planets as well as the challenge of exploring as much of the universe as possible has been one that has excited everyone from top physicists to the youngest child playing with her space ship toys but is the money spent on exploration of the universe justified or should it rather be allocated to helping those on this planet i believe that space exploration is justified in this essay the motivation for space exploration will be explored planet earth is ill humans have polluted the planet and destroying natural resources some might argue that the damage is irreparable global warming is causing the earth s temperature to steadily rise there is a possibility that in the next few centuries the planet may become inhabitable scientists like elon musk have recognised the dire situation that the earth is in and have started looking for an alternative new home planet it is possible that in the coming years there will be no other option than to move to a planet like mars therefore the costs involved in exploring this planet are justified if it is to house the entire human race space exploration also allows for new discoveries new minerals or compounds could be discovered on distant planets these could possibly be used on earth in various new technologies or even in medical science to treat illness or disease this could be invaluable to humankind since the dawn of the human race a characteristic that separates us from our animal relatives is our ability to tinker with existing knowledge as well as learn new things it has lead to humans becoming the dominant force on the planet new ideas prevent us from becoming stagnant thus driving progress if we continue to learn new things from space exploration we prevent stagnation lastly the idea that there could be life on other planets is one that has merit in my opinion humans cannot be so arrogant to think that there is no other life in the universe in conclusion it can be argued that space exploration does not hold merit and should be discontinued but the benefits that it offers outweigh the shortcomings ,8.5
1,The diagram below shows how Olive Oil is manufactured.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information below.,the olive oil is manufactured through several ways first of all the olives are picked from the trees by the farmers then the fresh olives are rinished using the cold water the machines used are specific and it helps belt to smash the olives after smashed the olives become either olive paster or the olive stones the next step is to put those into a bag with holes moving onto the next step it will be pressed by a certain pressurer it gives a great amount of weight on the olives so that it can be well pressed moreover it will be separated into either oil or water then it will be stored and sold to the consumers thus it is quite apparent that olive oil is manufactured by specific steps and so more olive oil is widely used as it is a good source for the chefs when cooking ,5.5
2,Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?,nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants in this essay the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed firstly people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats thus people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food the amount of food one person can consume differs on one s conditions at that moment the conditions include mood physical features and activities one did on that particular day furthermore one wants to taste all sorts of food however one can not eat all of those sometimes people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as instagram after taking photo people just leave the food the above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food apparently people can reduce the amount of food they throw away the restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell moreover consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money people should co operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land it leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas conclusively it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food ,7.0

2,People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,it is undeniable that crime inevitably contributes to negative consequences to society which affects in various aspects hence there is a belief that giving longer prison sentences could be the most effective way to reduce the crime rate nevertheless there are also opponents who believe that other effective mitigations are also available which i personally agree with it is true that being sentenced for a very long period is what people do not want to experience a criticism in favor of this is that those who live in prison will lack freedom this is because prisoners will be forced to stay in jail only meaning that they could not meet their companions as well as traveling to another country until the end of the prison term another common example which supports the idea of increasing the sentence term is that prisoners will be under control by authorities all time living in this condition would possibly result in the loss of privacy which is the experience that people tend to avoid in spite of the fact that giving longer sentences seems to be effective other solutions could also be applied a classic example is that people who break the laws must pay an extremely high penalty to governments since people do not want to lose their money this policy is likely to encourage people to follow the laws leading to the declining number of crime another potential solution could be done by schools to teach young generations about the effects of crime once students understand that committing crime would lead to the lower standard of living of people in communities such as reducing in the neighbors safety they tend to behave in the opposite way which is to improve the living conditions of other people instead and this would have hugely positive impacts in the long term in conclusion despite the fact that being in prison for a long time is a completely terrible experience for people because of no flexibility and privacy in life it seems to me that other alternatives which are paying higher fines and educating young people with respect to negative effects of crime tend to be more effective this is because these solutions are likely to address the root cause of committing crime and tend to be more applicable in the long run ,7.0

Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,the topic of whether giving longer prison sentences lead to a decrease in the rate of crime or some other alternative solutions might be helpful to reduce the rate of crime although it depends on each country s crime rate and cost i believe some alternative solutions will be realistic for reducing crime first of all some people believe giving a long sentence will be not only a safe solution but also useful to pay an attention to other people not to commit a crime they state that this is the best way in terms of cost and the organization well systemized they believe the crime rate will go down as a result on the other hand some people oppose the system the longer prison sentences have an influence to some extent but for the victims and their families can not be convinced and if alternative systems are well organized some crimes might be prevented in advance therefore it must be necessary to deploy the military or police in a specific area where crimes often occur this is effective to inhibit the crime rate finally crimes criminals often sporadically emerge even if the government stipulates the law which serves long prison sentences this is ubiquitous around the world therefore the most important point is how people need to become aware of dangerous situations and avoid not being involved in addition governments need to delegate stronger authority to the police and military to patrol around the specific area twenty four seven as comparatively higher crimes occur in the town this might be costly but it is worthwhile to configure a safe society ,6.0

Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,some people share the view that for minimising criminality offenders should go to jail for a long time while others are of the view that this problem should be tackled by using alternatives solutions i believe that the judicial system should look for other ways to punish criminals depending on the severity of the offence firstly by keeping people encarcelated for years the problem is locked up and there is no need to dealt with it until the sentence is served for instance for individuals who have committed a serious crime such as murder a long sentence is appropriate due to the severity of it and the criminal s possible danger for the society on the contrary for little criminals like robbery mild sentences or social hours should be considered as an option on the other hand by trying to get these individuals before they commit a severe crime could be a clever step for example in switzerland social workers work very hard to get mostly youngster an apprenticeship so they are kept busy and usually happy by placing people to jail for a long time they loose the contact to the outside world therefore trying to keep them outside doing the activities they were doing before the crime would be a reasonable in other words these citizens could wear electronically sensors so that the judicial services can check on them that would be a win win situation for the government society due to the lower cost compared to the jail expenses and for the individual who can continuing with his her life in brief despite some circumstances for jailing an individual i believe that alternative ways of punishment should always be on option depending on the degree of the crime ,7.0

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.,nowadays human activities are the main reason that cause problematic events or natural disaster around the world one of the most noticable causation is the deforestration the negative impact from cutting the forests can result in many horrible events in this essay we will take a look at how can the deforestration can cause many of the negative impact and disasters starting from clear cutting of forests and result in flooding and less biodiversity for the flooding the initial cause of the problem is when human eradicates the forest we usually used heavy equipment to invade the forest with all the equipments standing and pressurizing the soil the soil becomes hard and baked which makes the rain water to runs off and causing the flooding disaster furthemore for the less biodiversity impact the woods cutting can affects the bioecosystem from three main reasons first is when there is a deforestration project lower amount of trees and roots to hold the top soil which caused them to erodes second the risk of burning from the invading destroyed the waste wood from logging and decrease the amount of foods for micro organisms lastly lower amount of plants means less moisture returned to the air in which increased the rate of drought to happened from these three main causes it resulted in the pioneer species move in and vegetation is degraded and further caused a less biodiversity in the forest according to these informations the deforestration caused flooding events and less biodiversity in the forest from the artificial equipments that can cause the negative impact to soils and increase the chance of flooding also the interuption of the bioecosystem can cause less biodiversity in the forest ,4.5
2,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?",according to covid 19 event forced many company to change their way of working one of the most significant transformation is the communication the online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented in this topic we re going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications the online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021 first of all for the online communication s advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference for example a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons daughters at home while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently lastly as mentioned about video conference across region online meeting can help the multi national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting for the disadvantages all of the online communications required hardware internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them this technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications for example in one company there obviously have a various age of people in which some of them are not familiar with the technology since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago this can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces as a result online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities with all these advantages of online communication stated they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021 ,5.0
1,The flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.,the supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests as we can see there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue caused by deforestation according to the first branch from the left forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and baked it occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil as the first block of the chart says because soil becomes baked rain water starts to run off which causes flooding if we look at the remaining branches we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion less biodiversity but there are three different reasons for it the first one is soil erosion when we cut the trees we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes the second reason increased risk of burning it is followed by the destruction of waste wood then we have some micro organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation and it s all resulted in less biodiversity the last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air so less moisture enters the air this triggers less precipitation and so increased droughts plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity to conclude everything the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation ,7.5
2,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?",with new technologies come new ways to communicate with people first we had emails and now we have social media and a variety of different apps that give us the opportunity to chat with one another and this kind of online communication entered not only our personal but also our professional life this topic is rather controversial and people have different opinions about that so in this essay i m gonna be talking about pros and cons of the new type of working communication first i would like to start with some advantages of online communication at work in my opinion the main thing that makes people go from meeting face to face to talk online is the fact that it s more convenient we don t have to set a specific date to meet someone and also we can talk to someone from wherever we want without needing to drive to the office the two things we need are our cellphone or computer and the internet connection but i think nowadays it won t be a problem for anyone because the majority of people have each of this stuff the second advantage the functionality of apps for online communication let s take zoom i think almost everyone used this app in 2020 during lockdowns all over the world including myself you can arrange a meeting with thousands of people using this app this is much easier than gathering large amounts of people in one place you can also record this meeting if you wish and send this recording to people who were absent or use it yourself in the future to remember all the details face to face meetings do not provide us with all these opportunities if we talk about disadvantages i do not see a lot of them the only thing that we can miss in online communication is the ability to see human emotions and facial expressions i find it really important especially when it comes to discussing important projects or deals from my own experience i can say that when there was a lockdown in my country due to the pandemic i missed physical interaction with my colleagues such as handshaking etc i find physical interaction to be an effective way for team building so it s might be hard to work without it using only online communication to conclude i would say that everyone can have different opinions about whether it s better to meet online or face to face but what i am sure about is that we should not get rid of face to face meetings completely otherwise it will be hard to keep the team tigh knit ,7.5

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.,here on this scheme we re observing the whole diversity of forests cutting consequences from the threat of flooding to the biodiversity decreasing first of all the deforestation is horrible thing for soils its richness and fertility because of forests cutting soil becomes harder and it looses its ability to absorb the water as a result we could face the flooding after strong rains in addition soil starts to erod and we can see the vegetation degradation in this area as a result secondly the most important consequence of deforestation is biodiversity decreasing the land without enough quantity of trees can face drought and fires the vegatation will be degraded in a couple of years and a lot of species won t have an ability to stay there and find nutrition as a conclusion it s possible to say that we always need to evaluate all of the consequances of forest cutting before doing it probably the total cost would be so high that it would be cheaper to keep forets safe ,5.5

2,Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,education is one of the most important topics for childhood development and music can be very beneficial to children because it helps to sustain creative thinking and improve imagination some educators demand that music should be taught as a mandatory subject and yet some others think that forcing children to play music instruments will limit their chances to discover and develop other talents indeed music can be a great source for improving the lives of many children as well as their learning experience learning music instruments requires patience creativity and good discipline inherently in order to master a music instrument a good musician needs to sharpen his preserverence and offer all his best for a great performance often demands ten or more years of practice the heart of a musician the pursuation of perfection and persistence are all good qualities for a child to learn throughout his life in pursuing his career not only the career in music however despite all the good qualities that can be obtained through playing music instruments childhood education can be misdirected if the development of a hobbie becomes mandatory which of ocurse includes music instruments it might be beneficial for a child to experiment music instruments in his early years but not every child has the potential of being a professional musician making music a mandatory subject for primary and secondary school students could minimize their opportunities to discover different hobbies moreover making a bobbie a mandatory subject may also hinder the other learning experiences of a young child just imagine how stressful it is to study an unecessary subject on top of regular courses and other homework it does more harms than goods to the overall learning experience in conclusion it might be beneficial for a child to learn music instruments in his first school years but if he does not have the talent and does not enjoy music educators should consider dropping such suggestion and let him discover other hobbies ,7.5

2,Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,it is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument however i disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil first of all not all people are born with a talent for music which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease on the other hand there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and eventually they might start hating music instead of enjoying it some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby if all pupils spent time on music those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them undoubtedly everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want what is more playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career more time should be devoted to more important subjects such as math science and languages these have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school to sum up teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn t be a good idea it should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion but also it cannot be mastered by everybody ,6.5

Write a report to a university lecturer describing the data.You should write at least 150 words.,the given pie charts provide information on the nutritional consistency of two different types of dinner baked potato and macaroni overall it is clear that there are five types of nutritions available in both dishes eventhough the highest propotion is from carbohydrates furthermore saturated fat and other nurtients has the lowest percentage in both macaroni and baked potatoes medium baked potato is high in carbohydrates which is 35 and less in saturated fat and other nutrients moreover it has equal number of glucose and other nutrients which is 15 baked potato contains protine little less than carbohydrates which is 25 carbohydrates being the highest amount of nutrition that macaroni contains which is 52 of overall nutrient percentage and less in other nutrients it has more saturated fat than protine and glucose which is 21 macraoni containes equal number of glucose and protine which is 11 of total ,4.5
2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,it is important to experiance and learn certian kind of habits at younge age for children to develop them as they grow older growing vegetables and taking care of animals are two main practices children should develop at their younger age in this essay i will discuss some disadvatages that would affect children during this process and explain why i feel that there are better advatages the most significant advatage of learning to grow vegetables is that children will initally start to understand the importance of eating healthy and also the process of growing vegetables in this case children will learn not to waste food and how hard and the effort it takes to grow these vegetables it is important that we keep reminding children from their primary age so that they will remember and practice as they grow older taking care of animals is another important thing that children should learn in their primary this will teach children to care for others and not be frighten of animals furthermore they will learn to respect animals and love them some of the disadvantages of keeping animals is that some children has different types of allergies which will lead them to be more sick however some animals tend to be more dangerous than others another disadvatages is that when growing vegetables the compost and pestisides are dangerous to children or it might sometime be allergic to them as well insect bites during planting will also lead children to get sick in conclusion it is important to learn how to grow vegetables and take care of animals at their younger age since they develop certain habits and learn more indeapth which will be helpful as they grow older eventhough some argue that it is more riskier for children i believe that the advatages outweight disadvatages ,5.0
1,The pie graphs show the nutritional consistency of two dinners. Write a report to a university lecturer describing the data.You should write at least 150 words.,the pie chart depicts the nutritional consistency of two dinners clearly carbohydrates occupy the highest proportion of two dinners medium baked potato and macaroni than others initially carbohydrates have the highest percentage of both two dinners specifically it is 35 percent in a medium baked potato and surprisingly its percentage is more than half in macaroni in medium baked potato protein contains a quarter and it is the second highest percentage and two times higher than its percentage in macaroni another feature is saturated fat the percentage of saturated fat in medium baked potato is 10 whereas the percentage in macaroni doubles its percentage specifically it is 21 percent furthermore other nutrients in macaroni is a third compared with a medium baked potato it is 5 percent in macaroni and 15 percent in medium baked potato respectively when it comes to glucose it is 15 percent and 11 percent in a medium baked potato and macaroni respectively this is not a significant difference compared with other nutritional consistency ,6.5
2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,in primary school especially in the countryside in japan primary students have an opportunity to learn how to plant and grow vegetables in addition students need to feed and observe animal growth and health this is a great advantage for children to enrich their knowledge of how essential our lives consist in society it is obviously advantageous than disadvantages firstly the procedures to grow vegetables take a long time from cultivating the soil to harvesting vegetables when they grew up this means that it is great education for children on how to produce our food and agriculture industries have been paying an outstanding effort and time this education causes students to become aware of the necessity of gratitude to people who are working in these industries in addition it is also mandatory to keep animals in a good condition is worthwhile as young as possible animals also have lives and their lives easily devastate unless they are fed this is also the same in human lives young children will be able to recognize how sensitive to keeping animals a good condition and be more respectful to their own parents and how deep love they give to children as a result they are more willing to give a hand who need help finally these activities such as growing vegetables and keeping animals are not only helpful to learn what our society consists of but also more educational for children firsthand instead of watching documental tv programs through these activities children will become aware of current issues for example food consumerism extinction of animal species global warming and so on if they learned as young as possible the number of people who are concerned and make specific actions for these issues will increase as a result our lifestyle will improve more peacefully 動物 繊細に状況を観察していいコンディションを保つことの大切さを知る それは人にも共通しているため 世話を通じて親に対する感謝や 友人に対して暖かい言葉をかけることができるようになる ,5.5

Write a report to a university lecturer describing the data.You should write at least 150 words.,the pie charts illustrate the percentage of different types of nutrients carbohydrates protein glucose saturated fat and others presented in a medium baked potato and in a macaroni overall it can be observed that carbohydrates have the highest proportion in both types of dinner in addition saturated fat has the lowest percentage in medium baked potato while it is the nutrient with the second higher quantity in macaroni looking at the amount of carbohydrates it is possible to see that medium baked potato has 35 while in macaroni it can be found at 52 in a medium baked potato the amount of protein is more than a double than in a macaroni at 25 and 11 respectively in addition glucose has a slight difference at 15 in the potato and 11 in macaroni regarding saturated fat only one out of ten is presented in the potato although this number is much high in macaroni at 21 finally considering other types of nutrients its varies considerably at 15 in the potato and only 5 in the macaroni ,6.0
2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,some people believe that young children ought to breed animals and plant vegetables this essay will argue about some pros and cons of children working as farmers and also show that disadvantages overtake the benefits of it one the one hand it is a fact that young children who work looking after animals and plants learn how to respect the environment and develop an elevated sense of responsability certainly activities such as taking care of animals and grow vegetables favour children in many aspects of their lives like to have a better health mostly because of doing lots of outdoor activities and eating healthier food than city children on the other hand if children learn how to work as a farmer they could try to do it alone without any supervision which is surely a hard work with a lot of difficult and responsabilties in order words those tasks could be dangerous to a child and affect negatively its live for example it is necessary to use some special tools to deal with vegetables and those tools could harm easily a child in addition looking after animals and plants take too much time and children must spend their time studying and having fun instead of working in conclusion although the benefits that people can find in teaching young children to deal with animals and grow vegetables the disadvantanges of children doing those tasks are extremely high because of some permanent damages which could be caused by dangerous tools in my opinion young children should learn how to do it but they must not do those activities even if they were supervised by adults ,5.5

2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,nowadays it is widely believed that education has become an important aspect of our lives especially for primary children which have to be well educated before achieving the period of adolescence furthermore i hold on firmly to the belief that children should learn how to respect the environment especially the agriculture such as vegetables and the wildlife as animals to begin with children should learn how to cultivate and grow vegetables in order to respect the environment in other words children may experience some extra activities related to plants cultivation during or after school for instance educational institutions could organise some apprenticeship activities and teach how to cultivate and grow vegetables in addition to this it often claimed that taking part in these types of activities may develop children s skills and acquiring leadership skills moreover young students could experience different types of cultivation in order to gain knowledge of agriculture sector therefore these may be useful for children s career prospects and for their future secondly another vital aspect of our world that should be considered is the wildlife especially there some animals endangered in other words animals have become significant for the world s ecosystems and useful for companionship for example it is generally agreed that children may have to learn how to maintain animals additionally children could experience activities in animals protection associations in order to learn how to keep and protect animals with the support of some volunteers as a result children when they grow up are aware to the fact that animals are important and have to be always appreciated and respected in conclusion as far as i m concerned the advantages of learning how to cultivate vegetables and keep animals definitely outweigh the drawbacks additionally there is no doubt that children doing these activities may gain many positive experiences develop their skills and learn how value and appreciate the environment including wildlife ,7.5
1,The pie graphs show the nutritional consistency of two dinners. Write a report to a university lecturer describing the data.You should write at least 150 words.,the two pie graphs compare the nutritional components of medium baked potato and macaroni overall it can be seen that both dinners have the same five nutrients but the percentages of each nutrient within the two vary the medium baked potato has carbohydrates as it largest components with 35 of the total nurients protein follows as the second taking up 25 the remaining nutrients in the potato involve glucose saturated fat and other nutrients which constitues of 40 the whole nutrients by contrast the main nutrient in the macaroni is carbohydrates making up 52 of the total nutrients saturated fat takes up 10 doubling that in the potato however there is not much protein as in the potato as protein only contribute to 11 of the whole nutrients clucose and other nutrients constitue 16 in total in conclusion the percentages of the nutrients in two types of food could indicate that macaroni might be less healthier than the potato ,7.5
2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,it is proposed that elementary schools should teach their pupils vegetable growing and animal keeping skills although there are controversial views towards this proposal i believe that its benefits outweigh its drawback for a range of reasons stated below on the one hand experiences of vegetable growning and animals keeping can help children develop some first hand knowledge and some key characters that would benefit them in the long run firstly by involving in the process of vegetables growing children gain in depth understanding of the nature and its impact on the development of a life cycle in this case they are capable of learning some practiacal knowledge regarding how weather and seasons could either foster or destruct the growth of plants secondly keeping pets or other animals can encourage the deveopment of the pupils responsibility as they learn how to rountinely feed animals and take showers for them their responsbility and empathy also grow hand in hand which would lay a solid foundation for their future study family life and professional career on the other hand it may be argued that taking such courses could distact students from their intensive study it is not necessarily true because the aforementioned knwledge and skills can be transferble to their academic study and social life in schools for example their first hand experiences of growing vegetables can advance their understanding of some theoretical knowledge about plants in the bilogy class the empathy deveoped through raising animlas could be also taken advantage to strengthen relationships with teachers and peers in conclusion it is understandable that some people oppose the idea of the pupils learning vegetables growing and animals keeping but i strongly think that its advantages outweigh the disadvantages ,7.5
1,The pie graphs show the nutritional consistency of two dinners. Write a report to a university lecturer describing the data.You should write at least 150 words.,the pie graphs depict the nutritional consistency of medium baked potato and macaroni as dinner overall carbohydrates and protein contributed to a substantial amount of nutrition in both macaroni and medium baked potato whereas glucose and other nutrients made up a small proportion in addition to that the saturated fat in macaroni is drastically higher than in medium baked potato it is evident that the percentage of carbohydrates was up to 52 in macaroni compared to 35 in the medium baked potato the proportion of the protein in medium baked potato accounted for 25 which is more than two times higher than the protein in macaroni 11 however this trend reversed for the percentage of saturated fat as there are only 10 in the medium baked potato and 21 in the macaroni in terms of glucose both medium baked potato and macaroni consisted of a similar amount 15 and 11 respectively moreover there was 15 of other nutrients contained in medium baked potato while the figure in macaroni was only 5 ,8.5
2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,it is advised that toddlers should learn about growing vegetables and raising animals although there are downsides to this proposal the overall advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages in this matter the main advantage of teaching the younger generation how to farm vegetables and keeping animals is that it can enhance their understanding of the environment there is no doubt that school kids could learn about the environment on books but the most effective way is to interact with the habitation of vegetables and animals as they can easily be related with in addition by learning about foods and animals children could quickly develop their awareness of not wasting food only when children realize how difficult and complicated it is to nurture food can they stop wasting food or throwing food they dislike for instance public schools in melbourne developed a targeted curriculum to supporting primary children to learn about the growth of foods and the significance of preserving the environment and reduce food waste hence the advantage is obvious since younger pupils must recognise the world they live in however it is suggested that the physical risk of allowing primary offspring to learn about farming could not be overlooked one of the root disadvantages of caring for animals is the safety issue as animals might have potentially harmful effects on young kids to elaborate there is a mixture of the hidden virus on animals bodies due to the fragility of children s immune systems they are too vulnerable to defend against external viruses not to even mention the physical attack from animals to children according to the agricultural department there are 300 cases of animals attacking children reported every year in china which could be considered as a piece of strong evidence of the disadvantages in conclusion despite the potential drawbacks of learning about animals and floras the benefits of involving young toddlers in discovering about the environment still outweigh the downside ,8.0

2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,throughout history adult people have been those who worked on farms and they also were responsible for breeding animals recently it has been suggested that kids in elementary schools should also take part in such occupations in this essay i will count possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such a change in life in order to conclude whether or not it is a cost effective notion it is commonly believed that the enviroment has been endangered by imminent risks some people speculate that humans have been less connected to nature and therefore are not aware of the detrimental effects of their activities on the environment thus teaching children how to raise up vegetables and how to get along with pets can probably strengthen bonds between children and nature in early phases of life furthermore if children grew plants in early stage of life they would develop unique creative skills alongside enhancing their productivity moreover some experts claim that treating animals may benefit children as it would improve their social and communicational skills on the other hand there is another aspect which merits futher consideration some plants are known to be poisonous and unsafe to young people in addition growing plants and spending time on farms might make children prone to a few insects and reptiles which can be really dangerous finally animals could be harmful if they are treated inappropriately to recapitulate as we try to wiegh up the pros and cons of such an enterprise i still reckon that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages however in order guarantee the possible advantages i have mentioned upun above certain safety measures should be taken to offset the potential risks opposed to children as they are in proximity to plants and animals ,7.5

2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,children s development is one of the most priorities for most of the parents and they want to ensure that their children get all the needed interventions for their children s progress some people think that playing outside provide more benefits compared to playing computer games as a child who experienced both i agree that playing outside is more beneficial outdoor activities give children the opportunity to show and enhance their physical mental and social abilities if a child plays in the park he tends to explore different parts of the field by running or walking and this develops his physical health joining a camping could help a kid develop his problem solving skills making him use his basic knowledge about the activity a kid can also meet different children on a playground with the same wave length as his and this allows him develop to be sociable to others on the other hand computer games also gives kids a chance to develop their mental capabilities to the point that some get addicted playing it another disadvantage is it does not enable children to enhance their physical development other computer games offer problem solving activities logics and reasoning making children to exercise their cognitive abilities some games overstimulate the brain to the point that a player can get hooked and addicted to it to play long hours in addition most of the computer games are not physically interactive and let the players sit during the entire game this would not benefit children to develop their muscles although computer games could benefit children mentally but it has different disadvantages that outweighs the advantage of it children could develop more should they spend more time outside as it provides a chance for them to exercise explore and socialize to different children these reasons brought me to agree on the statement on this task ,7.0

2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,some groups of society are having the idea that outdoor activities are vital for children to improve their mental and physical skills rather than gaming in my opinion i agree that crafts and physical interaction between kids are essential for their development in all aspects modern technology which contains computer games may have negative effects on their overall development the reason why i believe that such activities are important is that kids are building their personalities during the first years of their life and this building process requires them to play and interact with their peers in real life situations which without any doubt can not be done through online games that do not offer this rich experience to them for example when a child faces her friends and communicates with them face to face doing some activities she will learn from them things that will contribute to her growth in many ways in addition to that reason outdoor activities offer authentic exposure to different situations which helps children to learn how to deal and manage their actions which will increase their awareness on the other hand computer games can not provide the exposure that may be needed to achieve such benefits to illustrate children who play outside their houses with their mates generally will give a specific and quick response to different situations in contrast with those who spend hours infront of computer screens in conclusion outdoor activities are valuable for what they give to children not only for their personalities to be formed and developed but also for their understanding to multiple real life situations ,8.5

2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children s development rather than playing computer games i share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children s life all people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality to do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects animals or playing different games such as football riding bicycles and many other this will only expand the knowledge of children and consequently have a positive effect on their development this is also important to have a healthy generation in the future parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active for example a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees the next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems which can cause computer games currently a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it to avoid problems with physical health in the future spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children of course little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children but it is important to limit it to sum up children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less ,8.5

2,"Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion",nowdays the developping of modern technologies in the trade sphere provokes a lot of discussions some people notice significant simplification in shopping process because of these technologies whereas the other part of society denies this influence as far as i am concerned shopping has definitely become easier due to invention of new payment decisions on the one hand it is really difficult to ignore the creation of new payment decisions in the last decades likewise internet acquiring or different mobile technologies like apple pay google pay etc the two key features of all these innovations have become firstly decreasing the number of steps in the payment process and absence of visualisation of your own money as well since you pay by card or by phone not by your cash because of these changes now the shopping is really easier for us regarding spending our money without any possibilities for extra thoughts at the same time some people can declare that due to modernisation and development of technologies a lot of companies and factories have started to create a huge variety of goods as a consequence customers usually struggle with choosing of what they actually need at this point of view it is possible to regard the modernisation not as something to make the shopping easier but as the opposite of it to clarify the faster development is going on the more confused an average customer is becoming because the harder for him to choose something and buy it as for my personal opinion i concern the progress as something that usually helps me to buy goods to elaborate i have never had any issues with choosing in the shopping that is why it is difficult for me to express some empathy to the people who feel uncomfortable with it i can conclude thus that the question of technologies and their influence in simplification in shopping is debatable there are some who spend their money easier then ever since the number of steps in the payment process has decreased but there are customers who have issues and find the same process less comfortable as for me i am inclined to the first groop of people because i ve also noticed a rised pace with that i ve started to make my purchases ,7.0

2,"In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?",classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history however the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music i believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and i will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs first of all the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts that is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes however all this knowledge is only superficial and arts more specifically classical music is diminished by the big international industry of music for instance reggaeton music despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous is the most popular style of music these days another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts in most countries investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost consequently governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts to summarise this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music as far as i am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art ,7.0

Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?",why classical music has not garnered the attention and recognition it deserves in this article we will cover all factors that have led to this question and will also provide my views on this highly debated topic classical music which is considered one of the oldest forms of music it has been a part of history if we look at the early 1800 s or at early 1900 s it was always classical music that garnered most attention and had people coming into concert halls to listen to musicians it was an integral part of music in all countries but with the evolution of music and introduction of more genres of music like rock pop and rap we have seen the rise in music which people found more appealing and intresting this has led to classical music being viewed as boring and stagnant this can be viewed as the primary cause in fall of the popularity of classical music for example going to a rock and roll concert which gets people involved and also allows them an opportunity to partake in the concert which as you could understand would appeal more to the youth as compared to a classical concert where people would just view and appreciate with minimum involvement classical music is also a skilled art that needs to be learned and honed but does not integrate any modern art for example michael jackson integrated dancing with his singing which widely appealed to the masses and encouraged youth into his concerts so if you could see a similar integration with classical music concerts it could attract more youth towards classcial music howerver with this discussion we cannot forget that as various genres of music have been derived from classical music and youth learning classical music with attending more classical concerts would help them achieve their future music endevors and also give them a good understanding of music in conclusion we can say that young people should be encouraged to go to classical music concerts as it would help them understand and appreciate music in its true form however attracting young towards classical music will need a evolution in classical music concert structure and integrate some components from other forms which would make it blend better with present day outlook ,7.5

2,Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?,there are many factors to encourage the quality of societies some people believe that competitiveness is the main factor to improve communities the following essay will focus on importance of competitiveness on individuals and cite my opinion which believe that it is a positive trend to develop societies first of all if you want to improve a skill of an individual in the differnet aspects of life like sport you should play him with higher level to develop his talent and get best of him for example a famous tennis table player from my town said in an interview that he improved his talent when he played against his older brother he was working hard in training sessions to reach the higher level the standard that his brother plays in order to beat him and win games the competetion between him and his brother lift up his skills and strenthgen his mentality secondly competitions may create good atmosphere and healthy climate for children to improve thier abilitie in study for example my daughter and her friends in the class were struggling in studying math the math teacher found a way to make the math more interesting for students the teacher announced for a competition every day at the end of lesson she writes an equations on the board and gives prizes for students who can solve them nowadays my daughter is enjoying to solve math problems furthermore competitions can improve people s career and increase company s outcome some managers tend to encourage competitiveness between employers to have more benefits for company and workers as well to conclude competitiveness enables people to improve their talents and students to love what they study also employers will develop their skills as a result of that most societies will get more benefits of this trend ,6.0

2,Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?,competitiveness is a desirable quality for individuals this essay will analyse the effects of competitiveness on people and illuminate my view as to whether the eagerness of competition represents an auspicious or ominous tendency there are mainly two types of influence exerted by competitiveness on people the most prominent repercussion resides in that the desire of competition drives people to work or study more diligently in order to stand out from the rest and achieve success such diligence enables people to accumulate sufficient experience that helps them improve capabilities and obtain better results apart from that another important effect of competitiveness is that competitors may seek considerable pleasure in competition especially when defeating competent rivals and obtaining hard earned victories such success makes people realise how excellent they are and gives them tremendous satisfaction even if losing the competition people may still be satisfied with such a precious opportunity that helps them understand their disadvantages and thus encourages them to work harder as far as i am concerned i opine that competitiveness is a positive phenomenon because it not only helps people become industrious learners or workers with sufficient experience and great potential of making progress but also makes their daily lives more enjoyable as beating strong opponents may give them a unique sense of satisfaction therefore i think that the importance of competitiveness should never be underestimated to sum up the effects of competitiveness can be manifested by the impetus driving people to work or study harder and the unique pleasure of competing against strong rivals personally i hold that this is an auspicious trend ,8.5

2,"Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?",many metropolises are facing challenges including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live particular in the developed countries the governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there it is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations these are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living a larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities simultaneously it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place the business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems a place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing food housing and transportation which are basic needs of human if there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption as a consequence the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases therefore the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas this may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues my own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises but the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town ,6.5

2,"Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?",it is often argued that by moving large companies factories and it employees traffic and housing problems could be irradicated i completely agree to this fact that these problems could be solved by taking this step traffic and housing problems has been a major problem in big cities due to the increasing population in these areas the main contribution to the rapidly growing population are the multinational companies and the industries that have been set in the cities these companies have a thousands of employees as a result if these companies are established in cities it will lead to lot of traffic for example mumbai a major city in india has uncontrollable traffic due to the vast it sector present there it has been very difficult for the people living in mumbai to travel even the shortest distances as it takes a lot of time to move from one place to another the demand for housing also increases due to large number of employees from industries and huge companies which inturn leads to drastic increase in the expenses for housing as a result they have to compromise for small houses due to high rents the only solution for this problem is by mobilising the big companies and industries to countryside which has a lot of empty lands by taking this step it is both benefitial to the companies as well as the employees the cost of establishment of the companies will be significantly low in the outskirts of the cities and the rural areas compared to the city the employees also save a lot of time due to relatively less traffic and they also benefit to a large extent by low housing exenses the traffic housing problems and the pollution in the cities will also be reduced by taking this initiative to conclude the employees the people in the citiesand the companies as a whole could benefit by mobilising the industries and multinational companies from the cities to the country side due to the above reasons ,6.5

2,Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,there is an opinion which is that the longer prison sentences is the best solution to reduce crime on the contrary some people say that there are better solutions to solve this problem overall i totally agree with the latter opinion because i think that giving long prison sentences can not directly reduce crime firstly i observe the advantage about giving longer prison sentences surely people may hesitate to commit crime by strict sentences even if they would commit crime they would have to be in prison for long days in addition living in prison for a long time may give a time to reflect themselvs for them however if crimers would be in the prison for a long time it might be difficult for them to make them living on themselves because they might not be used to the social reality it may cause them to commit crime again in addition to this i think the poverty and a lot of burdens which people have may cause to commit crime because of two reasons i think that countries have to propose policies which can stimulate economy and relieve their anxieties recently many countries have experienced a recession it cause the increasing the unemployment rate so a lot of people suffer from hunger because of the povery it will be supposed to cause them commit crime such as robbing then people have many burdens because of woriking raising their children and caring their parens they have a lot of stress so even if they could not reduce their stress they might commit crime to reduce their mental pain they may want a relax time i think the latter opinion is more valid than the former by these reasons these are my opinion about this problem ,6.0

2,Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,nowadays due to increasing of crime rate some people tend to think of the best way to decline crime is giving a longer prison sentences however some criticisms probably believe that there should have much better ways to decrease crime in my opinion that is true to some extent for this statement that means the prison sentences may be necessary but i perfer the other ways such as education and detenion center rather than the prison sentences especially for minors firstly it is possible to said that increasing the punishment would decline the crime in the society considering the fact that most of citizens afraid to lose their freedom as a longer time given the circumstance hong kong goverment established a policy which force people to scan the qr code with the leave home safe app for against the covid 19 it was not very common initially without any punishment yet after announcing the 10 year prison sentences amd 60 throusand dollar fines hongkongers use the app quite often now so that probably means that the more punlishment they will get the more attentive and cautious they will have on the other hand it seem likely to have another proper ways to reduce the crimes one example is creat a better and well rounded education for people particularly for youngsters some people could think of it is a more efficient way to develop and nurture thier manner for their whole life for example there are a lot of different kind of extra curriculums which consist of having a talk with polices and icac for students to join and teach them some form of concept to be a good citizen and take their responsibilities living in hong kong perhaps it can show them some societal expectation rather than arresting them and destroy their future to summarize there are different opinions for this statement even so i believe that if we had spoon feed information and set a better model for people it will help people to reflect on their bad behaviour likewise if goverment only established a lot of punishment for his residents consisently they may feel stress out it is probably not good for a long term development for a morden as well as international city and country ,6.5

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,from the map we can see three possible locations for a leisure centre each prospective location has different surroundings the a mark is situated near some factory or energy plant with a dense smoke all around the b mark is near apartement buildings and the c mark is surrounded by hill and forest it is also clear from the map that different proposed locations have different transport accessibility there is a road connecting the a and b marks along with the apartements while the c mark is not accessible with vehicles another notable feature is the river crossing the middle of the map while the a and b locations are close enough to the river the c is quite far from it having no direct access to water finally the forest separates the c mark from all the infrastructure and pollution of the living block and the factory introducing some pros and cons which should be considered ,7.5
2,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",today the advertising has become very powerfull thanks to the television and the internet but is it true that it is now more important in terms of sail rates than the goods themselves and the actual requests of the society first of all i think that usually in the one selected price range all the products serving the same purpose have more or less equal properties such as quality or taste this is indeed true for example for many electronic devices which are are produced by the nearby factories somewhere in china regardless the brand and therefore their sales depend more on marketing strategies however if the one buys the goods of well known brand he trusts the experience beneath this brand this is a kind of assurance that a consumer gets excactly what he expects and that a product is not defective for instance when choosing the car you probably would firstly consider bmw or mercedec the reason why you know them is not only good advertising but also quality proved by millions of clients throughout the years moreover i believe that modern society actually moves towards the conscious consumption this implies people becoming more and more awared of product and its manufactoring process ratheer than advertising from that the decreasing of the aggressive marketing follows though the marketing still has cruical role in fact its focus changes so that it will become more informative and less disturbing in the future in conclusion i want to disclose my own point of view i do agree with the topic to the certain extent though i am sure advertising is only a one reason of high sales among many others and its influence will decrease with time ,7.0

2,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",there is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods the high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods in this essay i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion in terms of advertising s power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods advertising has an essencial role these days in sales the main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way to illustrate using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly people spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing however some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products on the other hand some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products in conclusion i believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products also smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods as was previously menthond people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate ,6.5

2,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",based on some alledges publicity is the main reason for the high rate of selling not humans requirements although in my point of view commercials are impressive in realms that people are looking for to address their demands however some other factors are uttered here one of the most highlighted contributors has to do with the high quality of accepted brands among their rivals to enlighten some domestic brands that have been even supported by both public and similarly authorities never can compete with other abroad commodities as not only in the real of quality but in terms of price also they cannot attain any level among other imported things as a vivid case japanese cars are utilized in the majority of countries while other companies such as american ones have lost their attraction owing to their high rate of consumption of fossil fuels furthermore based on the alternations that have taken place in the world like either the increasing population or the change of lifestyle both the type and as well the number of substances that used to be utilized have undergone drastic shifts for instance individuals usage of fast foods has skyrocketed in the last decade due to the lack of time for cooking hence the development of takeaways is eye catching while the number of their customers has swelled sharply on the other hand whereas advertising has been effective for some international firms it would not be feasible if the improvement of transportation did not emerge to illustrate the main role is played by second to none commuting systems for delivering divergent products therefore without their assistance introducing goods to other parts of the universe seems to be meaningless while society does not have access to them as their choices to conclude while publicity nowadays is exploited as a means for enhancing the chance of selling in different markets to me it is impossible to become prosperous if folks do not need those things nevertheless other justifications that are associated with the appeal of various merchandise namely their quality should not be ignored ,5.0

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,the table indicates the annual income of secondary high school teachers and comparisons in 2009 overall it can be seen an increase from starting year and after 15 years in all countries to go into detail there are two countries in australia and denmark where teachers annual income reached the maximum salary within 10 years specifically the annual income started at 28 000 45 000 in australia and denmark respectively afterwards the salaries reached 48 000 54 000 within 9 years and 8 years in australia and denmark when it comes to other three countries luxembourg japan and korea those three countries teachers steadily increased their annual income however they kept working after 15 years and reach maximum later in japan and korea their annual income gradually increase the longer they worked for example the first years annual income in each country is 34 000 30 000 in japan and korea respectively after 15 years their incomes soared to 65 000 and 48 000 as a result their maximum income will reach the peak of 37 years and 34 years in japan and korea the salary is 86 000 64 000 in japan and korea interestingly in luxembourg the annual saralies start at 80 000 and increased to 119 000 after 15 years in contract there is not so huge gap between after 15 years annual income and maximum it is 119 000 and 132 000 furthermore the maximum salary tend to reach in 30 years it is a litte bit earlier than japan and korea ,7.5
2,The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,in recent years news reports on tv programs and news papers tend to focus on incidents and emergencies rather than positive developments in japan because of this phenomenon many people are influenced this country might be more dangerous than they thought i disagree with these tendencies and should focus on more positive developments including entertainment to go into detail in japan once people turn on the tv in the morning people face often face some news reports about a murder case who were murdered who is the criminal and background details in addition there are more than 5 channels on tv these all 5 channels broadcast the same incident at the same time the japanese government might take the control of media in order to agitate people to keep their attention on safety it might be important to some extent but it is not necessarily a good influence on people s mind if they were required to watch such a fierce and negative incident every morning in contrast when it comes japanese crime rate and case they reached a peak of 2014 and keep decreasing until now the cases are not significant derrence compared with a few dacase ago in addition almost japanese crimes tend to be petty crimes such as thefts frauds shop lifting and so on in terms of the murder case japan is ranked as the 5th safest country among 160 countries in 2017 this means that the more media reported the savage crimes people misunderstand japanese society is getting more dangerous than a few decades ago finally it is understandable to report such a heavy incident to some extent on the other hand they should also report positive and attractive news such as tourism especially inbound sales figures has been increasing and contributing to japanese economic growth and some japanese athletes have been successful in mlb major league baseball and football this news must be more fascinating for japanese people to encourage their own national identity in conclusion this is not a black and white issue but it might be more beneficial for people s minds to be positive if some heavy incidents happened the japanese government should restrict tv companies to broadcasting only one channel or limit the time shorter ,6.5

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.,the table indicates the wages of secondary high school teachers in 2009 it could be seen that luxembourg has the highest salaries among each group namely starting after 15 years and maximum but there are other properties varying from country to country such as the ratios between groups and the number of years to reach maximum salary it is notable from the table that in denmark one could reach maximum salary in only eight years which is the lower value for comparison the highest value is 37 years in japan another feature is ratio between starting salary and maximum one in all the considered countries this ratio exceeds one and a half in japan and korea it is even greater than two except denmark where it is approximately equal to 1 2 the third column is only important for luxembourg japan and korea since others have the last column less than 15 and therefore the maximum wage is the same as the wage after 15 years for the three named countries however we may analyze the dynamics of salary growth more precisely ,7.5
2,The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,news reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole let us consider the purpose of the media existence first i suppose it is to spread important information so that people may use it in their lives and problems are usually more important than some positive developments since in fact they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place for example due to the covid which is an international problem many people lost their jobs if they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though they would have prepared somehow save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses learn a new profession and so forth moreover i believe problems shall be solved and when people are concerned about some problems they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them for instance the energy crisis is a huge problem and it is important to aware society of it so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity in the end society will benefit from it so it is not harmful on the other hand there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes but i am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals rather than a problem of today s media system people just should not fall in despair because of news reports but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems finally in my view the stated tendency is not really harmful to society but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals and they are responsible for it ,8.5

2,"Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?",it is argued by some people that because nowadays people live longer than they used to retirment age should be raised in my opinion i think that companies should use other measures to determine the right time for retirment in recent years many companies have set rules for retirment age this is because these companies believe that when people reach a certain age they do not performe as good as younger employees as a result many experianced employees lose their jobs which can affect both employees and companies for example some companies require experianced employees to retire at the age of 60 which can lead to loss of valuable knowlege that can be used to train younger employees to solve this problem companies can use different measure to help them decide when to ask their emplpyees to retair or resign on the other hand i believe that companies should focus on their employees performance and work quality rather than their ages the reason for this is that companies should retain well performing employees which has nothing to do with age for instance companies can monitore their employees work quality as a way to meaure their ability to continue working as a consequence companies would have a stronger performance compared to other companies who use age as a measure this is because they will have experianced and well performaing employees at the same time in conclusion while companies uses ages to measure when it is the right time to retire i believe that other measures such as performance and work quality should be used ,6.0

2,"Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?",people nowadays are living much longer with the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably i don t agree with this idea rather than involving the life expectancy of a person we should consider the job itself is it tiring does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem if the job is tiring i think that it would be better for a person to retire if you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire the question ought to be is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work the older you get the slower you become this is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person the ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control let s imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building what if a wall suddenly falls does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker i am an optimistic person but i would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person i would like to wrap up this essay by saying that i could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer of course this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach ,5.0

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,most of the citizens believe that all countries should focus on producing more materials or items in their prime targets although some others think that it is not a suitable target i strongly agree with the idea of production and i will explain why it is in this essay first of all countries should have a strong economy to survive and meet their citizen s expectations and for the strong economy they should produce new materials and do more researches to create new products and goods so governments should open new fabrics and research labs for the related sectors in order to create a big economy for their future for example they can give the opportunity to invent their own electronic vehicle in the country and this will allow everyone to buy it cheaper and easily instead of buying from other countries which is a best example of the importance of the new products on the other hand some people believe that tourism and entertainment have big impact on the country s economy for example even though dubai is half desert nation the government create a big tourism sector all over the world that everyone heard about the country s name although there are not any factories to produce materials or goods but there are many entertainment actions such as img world legoland and many more inside the country and these are working very well and taking attention of the other people for tourism purposes in conclusion governments should give effort to produce and develop new products and goods for the country s future although they can also use the other opportunities to create a well economy for their people such as tourism and the other sectors but in my opinion they should have goals for more production and creation ,6.5

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,some think that the main objective of the countries should be the increment of production of materials and goods i partially disagree that the constant increment in production is an appropiate goal becuase it has some negative consequences the idea of increasing constantly the production of materials and goods is based on the globalization process where each export and import goods and products it is part of the globalise commerce however it is well known that this practise represent negative aspects for the domestic economic and for the worldwide environment for instance in the free trade relationships between coutries they negotiate the interchange of products nontheless in many times those trades produce a surplus or contrary a lack of products that increment the inflation or deflation of prices as a consequence of the invisible hand of adams smith that represent the offre and demand addiotionally the extraction of some natural resources such as gold coal and crude are affecting drastically our planet consequences such as global warming and huge amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are depleting the ozone layer therefore these practices of production should be executed with the purpose of fullfil the needs of the society instead of make of this a profitable source for instance natural resources should be only extracted to produce energy rather than consumed products such jewelry and so on if we do not control our production of materials and goods some natural disasters and social issues such as poverty and hunger will keep affecting human beings negatively in conclucion although some people consider that each country should increment its production of raw materials and products as a main goal i strongly believe that it is crucial to stablish a balance between this objective and others that affect our ecosystem and equity ,5.5

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities i agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and i will highlight some of them to begin with manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries for instance china is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies such emergencies are pandemics financial crises and many more by growing the production of goods and materials a country will always be a reliable business partner thus companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners moreover countries should be aware that by increasing their production for example there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips on the contrary india is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities to conclude i agree that more in house production is necessary it is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the gross domestic product of a country ,6.0

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,the population of our planet has been growing at a fast pace and thus meeting the demand for goods has become a tough achievement some people in order to face this issue assume that every country should aim at producing more materials and goods i do not concur with this statement rather than increase the production of goods and materials a country ought to sensibilize its citizens not to dismiss goods that are still able to function properly getting rid of goods that still work just because the new one has been released forces every country to produce more and more good leading to a worsening of our enviroment another pivotal factor that i would like to underline is the fact that people from developed countries do not have a shortage of goods not at all consumerism is predominant in these areas and thus these countries should reduce their productions most of the things they use daily are useless and they serve as amusement i firmly believe a person can live perfectly without having 5 different cars in my opinion the fact that a country should aim at increasing its production of materials and goods has another leak that i have briefly mentioned before a higher level of production would lead inevitably to a higher level of pollution that would be consequently released into the natural environment eath is already facing some very important issues when it comes to problems related to pollutions lastly i think that we should focus on how to produce less or at least on how to produce the same amount of goods and materials but in a more environment friendly way ,5.5

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,the view of how much goods and natural resources a country should produce differ massively some people are the view that countries should increase their production and that this is an appropriate aim i strongly believe that countries should not increase their production of such goods and resources firstly the market will tell countries how much of these resources are needed therefore the need of constantly enlarge their production is not necessary and additionally a negative aspect can be that companies will not be able to sell their products by regulating production countries areto make their products expensive if there is a high demand or cheaper if there are not enough buyers for instance if much steel for construction is needed the countries which exploit that resource will be able to ask for a higher price furthermore countries with many natural resources can t access their goods at any time due to lack of machinery or power and workforce for example during the pandemic many chinese companies have been working in low mode now that various countries have started to open up china can not keep up with the demand and produce all the goods due to a power shortage indeed this development will bring many severe consequences for the local and international economy on the contrary by growing the production of goods and materials a country will always be a reliable business partner thus companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners moreover countries should be aware that by increasing their production they can also make harm to the environment which will bring numerous consequences such as waste water pollution high emission levels in brief despite some short term economic incentives i strongly believe as stated in the paragraphs above that the need for that increase in goods and resources is not necessary ,7.0

2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,nowadays it seems that the goal of every nation should mainly focus on economic purposes such as increasing production of materials and goods however i personally believe there are more important things than the economy which governments should pay more attention to for example health systems education fundamental rights etc despite this in my opinion production should be also a main goal but it is also crucial for the well being of the country to make a balance among all objectives on the one hand countries rely on the economy in order to make money provide people with jobs and make a way of living so i believe production of material and goods is essential in every economy nevertheless constant increasing of production is not very healthy for the country as it may end in a surplus of goods and materials moreover the situation could get worse if companies would not know what to do with all the excess products on the other hand taking care of inhabitants of a certain country is as important as producing without health education and values most nations would not survive i also believe that you cannot have a strong economy without a healthy population as people are the ones that work in production in other words both aims complement each other perfectly as a conclusion i would like to highlight the fact that constantly increasing production does not benefit anyone it also may harm people and governments should be more aware of other complex issues like the ones mentioned above ,6.5

Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,as society becomes more and more saturated with technology traditional cultures are losing their roles in society the compatibility of technology and traditions are often debated where some suggest it is possible whereas others argue it is not in this essay i will discuss both perspectives and conclude by saying how and why it is almost impossible since people usually appreciate limited ways of living it is challenging for both conventions and technology to co exist they will usually choose one method or another but not both at the same time for instance a company would have to focus on using human labour or advanced machineries to produce a product the incompatibility may not be obvious at first but as technology develops futher use of machines will increase but employment will decrease furthermore technology is often considered to be more convenient and faster by many people work can be done more efficiently so workers will start to abandon the old ways of living or working in contrast it might be possible for two values to work along in society due to different tastes of various people traditional cultures are usually appreciated by old generation such as grandparents meanwhile new generation prefers technology in their life for example grandparents can read newspaper while grandchildren watch tv or play games during family time moreover although it is hard for a company to use both at the same time it is not totally impossible if the number of machines is controlled during production human labour and machines can work together to maximise productivity by covering up each other s disadvantages all in all even though traditional values and technology can be compatible theoratically it is indeed difficult to compromise the use between two in real life ergo people would have to beware of the risk of losing traditional cultures if at all ,7.0

2,"Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",some people complain that people who work in the entartaining industry such as film stars pop musicians or sports stars earn excessively huge ammount of money i agree with that statement however i believe that other more essential proffesionals such as doctors teachers rescuers should be highly paid on the one hand entertainers earn incredible sum of money which can be estimated much more times than ordinary people obtain thier salaries usually allow famous celebrities live very wealthy they possess expensive properties laxury cars have vocations in the best resorts which a person from another sphere hardly can afford of cause it seems not a matter of the fact that they earn more money than others but for some people that fact can be observed as unfairness because the jobs of celebrities are not a rocket of science however this is a famous postulate that demand creates supply that is why demanded professionals have higher earnings than others for as long as people have possibilities and willingness to make their lives more brighter and interestings they will pay for entertaining businesses this is the main reason why entertainers usually wealthy and rich on the other hand some proffesionals such as doctors teacher rescuers can be recognised like more important than entertainers nevertheless they usually underpaid or their earnings can be even so little that it is hard to survive for them i belive that those people play the more essential roles in the skill development health improvements and safty of life in general in my opinion population should pay more attention to those kinds of proffesions additionally governments should support financially such workers from vitaly important idustries moreover those professionals are usually in demand by that i mean they should be payed as demanded employees such as entertainers no less in conclusion some professionals such as entertainers are paid extremely more money because they are in demand however some professionals such as doctors teachers rescuers usually underpaid i belive that people as well as government should reconsider the salaries of workers based on their achievements and importance for a society ,6.0

How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,in the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated one of the main causes of the temperature rising are men made activities almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment for instance some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting indeed the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation s abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming lastly even if it is the more impacting there is the industral system and their production of slags the first impact made by men activities concerns the product they use there are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature first there are products like lacquaer and foam because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades they have been one of the main causes of the ozone hole spray products even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition another men activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation indeed the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea s pollution furthermore the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem lastly one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system indeed they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste the problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines furthermore the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials for instance the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world it abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them finally the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial indeed in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea this tendecy was increased for two reasosns saving and speed these are the two eassential words of industrial system in conclusion i think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others those that concern the personal and daily activities of men use of determinate products and ways of trasportation and then those activities operate by the industrial system ,6.0

How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,two centuries ago when people celebrated the evolutionary development brought by industrialization no one would ever anticipate that a profound change of global climate would be caused by the machines humans had made however many ecologists point out that human activities have put a massive burden on the ecosystem which leads to increasingly higher global temperatures this essay will explain the major causes of global climate change followed by several plausible solutions it has been widely recognized that excessive greenhouse gas emissions are the culprit of global climate change and burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions first our daily life in a modern society heavily relies on electricity acquired mainly through burning fossil fuels like coal a colossal amount of smoke predominantly carbon dioxide is released during this process as a result the smoke captures excessive heat on the earth resulting in an increase in global temperatures second consuming oil impacts global temperatures in the same way as the energy from burning fossil fuels cannot meet the rapidly growing needs more and more oil extraction programs are set up to acquire petroleum the process of both drilling oil and consuming it creates a significant amount of greenhouse gases thus burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are significant causes of climate change however although lowering greenhouse gas emissions is challenging several actions could decelerate the effect one major step is to urge the energy dependent companies to reduce productivity and create more jobs in green industries like large cloth manufacturers giant companies need a significant portion of energy to keep their machines running every day by reducing productivity the amount of energy they need can drop at the same time the government should increase investment in green industries to maintain a healthy employment rate on the other hand individuals can make their own contribution by reducing their personal carbon footprints every small step such as turning off the lights when leaving home taking public transportations instead of driving cars or simply eating less meat can make big changes in conclusion the excessive greenhouse gas emissions released mainly by burning fossil fuels and consuming oil have caused an alarming increase in global temperatures nevertheless this problem could be alleviated by a collective effort of giant companies and individuals ,8.0

How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,despite knowing about the adverse effects of climate change human activities have been highly responsible for global warming for decades this essay will discuss the main causes of temperature rising including the excessive use of fossil fuels and plastic pollution this essay will further suggest solutions to these problems including decreasing the consumption of fossil fuels and reducing the dumping of waste in the sea most people are guzzling fossil fuels churning out greenhouse gases and messing with our planet s climate like there s no tomorrow for instance driving to the grocery store burns a certain amount of fuel resulting in an increase in carbon footprint the combustion of fossil fuels emits co2 which in turn traps heat in the atmosphere hence making it the primary contributor to global warming moreover dumping plastic in oceans deprive phytoplanktons of sunlight as a result the planktons are not able to carry out photosynthesis a process that removes co2 and releases oxygen which leads to disruption of the world s carbon cycle and ultimately makes the planet warmer thus human activities that contribute to an escalation in co2 emissions are the prime causes of a rise in global temperature substituting fossil fuels with other renewable energy sources and reducing plastic usage are both critical to mitigating this phenomenon for example people should install solar lights in their homes instead of led bulbs we should also curb the buying of processed or canned foods and should always take our own paper bags while going grocery shopping to prevent the use of plastic bags furthermore using public transportations rather than private vehicles for commuting would significantly alleviate our carbon footprint therefore if humans shift to renewable and recyclable materials then it would drastically minimise the temperature rising issues to conclude people s actions that change the environment have a negative impact on the global climate however we can substantially lessen it by curbing fossil fuels and plastic usage ,8.0

2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,some people believe that educational facilities must accept the same numbers of men as women in every subject there are both pros and cons in this argument which will be discussed in this essay a tremendous number of people think that equality is crucial for education nowadays more and more activists fight for women s rights they want that every female can study everything that she prefers notwithstanding this is socially acceptable or not moreover many feminists suggest that patriarchal societies do not allow women to study equality with men for example when a little boy says to his younger sister that she is not intelligent enough for the men s play a little girl grows up and thinks that she cannot study men s subjects and work men s jobs therefore the main reason to accept equal numbers of both sexes is to crush many stereotypes about women s intellectual abilities and allow them to choose which subject they really want to study on the other hand some people can complain that this is discrimination against men for instance if every university will accept only 50 of men with the highest grades in every subject men with average grades but higher than women s will not be accepted furthermore this idea does not guarantee that all wise women will study in universities females also can do not want to learn every existing subject in conclusion the main point of equality in education is about choice not coercion from my point of view that would be great if male and female students could study the same subjects if more boys prefer to be teachers while more girls like to be scientists however this is impossible when a lot of stereotypes exist and the coercion of universities to accept balanced numbers of students based on their genders does not help solve the global issue with equality ,7.0

What implications do the indicators have for the countries?",the table illustrates social and economic indicators in 1994 for four nations canada japan peru and zaire those statistics are taken from the united nations records overall japan had the highest annual incomes per person and life expectancy at birth while canadian daily calory intake were the highest moreover canada and japan had the highest literacy rate loooking at the economic indicator japan annual income per capita stood at 15 760 which was the highest income among the four nations and was followed closely by canada at 11 100 by comparison zaire was the poorest country with an annual salary per capita at 130 peruvians were earning 160 annually turning to social indicators japaneses had the highest life expectancy at birth being 78 years old and canadians had the second highest at 76 years old people from zaire and peru had a limited life expectancy at 47 and 51 years old respectively in addition canadians are the citizens who ate the greatest amount of daily calories 3326 while people from zaire ates the least 1749 finally japan and canada had the highest rate of literacy both at 99 in contrast zaire rate of literacy accounted for only 34 ,6.5
2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,regarding education gender equity is crucial some people argue that universities should enrol an equal number of men and women in every field personally i totally agree with that statement because i believe it is fairer and it is better for the society the main reason male and female students should be equal in number is that it would be more equitable in fact numerous studies have stated that their brains are not working the same way in other words their cognitive capacities are different so they should not compete with each other for university admissions it does not mean that a gender is more intelligent than the other for example men are generally known to have a better spacial orientation while women s ability to memorize is superior similarly their physical capacities are not the same either and that is why men and women do not compete against each other in sports competitions another reason to separate sexes regarding university admissions is because it ensure a better distribution of gender among the labor market broadly speaking it is well known that males work in their life more hours that females this is principally due to the fact that women take more maternity leave than men unfortunately it can consequently create a problem in the society for example nowadays women represent the majority of students in medicine as they have better grades in high school as a result there is not enough working staff in hospitals when they quit to take care of their families the same situation applies to every field with a majority of women such as jobs in health services in conclusion i reiterate that there should be an equal number of male and female students enrolled in universities because it would be more equitable and ensure a better repartition of genders among different fields of employment ,7.0

What implications do the indicators have for the countries?",the table illustrates the social and economic indicators of canada japan peru zaire in 1994 based on united nations statistics overall the indicator includes four aspects annual income life expectancy at birth daily calories supply per person and the adult literacy rate expresses in among these countries as can be seen the countries which scored the most in each section were canada peru was placed in third place followed by zaire the highest annual income per person was verified in japan with 15 760 whereas canada obtained 15 760 however it is notably the marked difference in this index compared to peru and zaire 160 130 respectively regarding the daily calorie intake per individual were 3326 kcal in canada 2864 in japan and peru with 1927 the least assumptions had shown with 1749 in zaire furthermore life expectancy at birth had expected to be higher in japan with 78 similarly canada was closer with only 2 fewer points following by 51 in peru and 47 in zaire the percentage of adult literacy as can be noticed is expected to be longer in canada and japan with the same score of 99 in contrast it dropped to 68 in peru and the lowest level of adult literacy reached only 34 in zaire lastly it is interesting how by seeing the adult literacy rate the other indexes go well likewise the highest income can be beneficial to get a good score on the other indicators ,6.0
2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,nowadays universities are accepting all the students as many men as women in every subject matter i believe that being open to all students is fair the university must allow everyone to study what is interesting for each individual regardless of gender however i think that the numbers of equality in each course are statistically speaking unrealistic even though in general i completely agree that there must be equality and human rights nowadays many are the organizations created to support equality sex discrimination with the aim of helping people to get their rights however despite enormous positive changes compared to the past still some people reckon that some jobs are for women and others for men what does it even mean should a woman only do house chores and raise kids as can be seen based on women s experience a woman can be a businesswoman and a great mother at the same time there is an old saying give me an educated mother and i will give you an educated nation therefore i disagree with some people s beliefs men and women can be great in different jobs and positions however having the same number of students in each course is impractical for universities realistically speaking there are some courses which attract more one gender than the other in terms of numbers if we think that for instance in the nursery degree there is 50 of females and then the other half will be waiting to be filled form males it would be harsh for the university to close the course with the same parity of future students in a nutshell universities should not accept only one gender for a particular course or most of that gender with a fixed number as the applications arrive at the university they should select people based on their skills knowledge and merits no matter if the course will be 80 females and 20 male or vice versa ,6.0

Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,the problem of understainding whether there is an age that could be consider perfect to have a child is very debated it is nowadays very common to have children over 40 years old after explaining the reasons besides this tendency a different life style and conception of education and the role that women play in our society i will argue in favour of this tendency by explaining that the disadvantages can be outweighed the reasons why today people have children in their later age are due to two factors firstly there is a new conception of education and people when finish their studies sometimes have to wait years before finding a good paid position on the other hand new technologies and new medical treatments have made people around 60 looking in the same way as my grandmother was in her 40 the central cause of this tendency is surely linked with the role that women play in our society they study and work and they have to find a good job position in the same way as their male counterparts have to do this involve that a woman cannot take the time that she need to grow up a child when she is 25 at that age she is usually in academia yet rather she will think about the possibility of having a child after started her career then there are positive effects produced by this new tendency children are loved and considered by their parents as miracles on the other hand they can grow up in a family in which his parents have good jobs neither the mother or the father have to sacrifice a part of their life because they had a child too young my mum got me when she was over 40 twenty three years ago this was consider an exception although i confronted my self with the possible disadvantages that could be produced by having child late i cannot present them as real issues people believe that a not young parent cannot understand your needs and your thoughts however this is false indeed if a person is open minded she will always is whatever the age the only possible disadvantage concerns the fear of losing your parents soon while people start to think about the possible death of their parents when they are around 30 years old i started to think about that when i was 20 but it is just fear therefore i believe that there are not concrete reasons to be against this tendency if we start to conceive the idea of having a baby as an immense gift we will reasonably have to understand that we have to be prepared to grow up the child and to dedicate to him all the time he needs then it is amazing if this is possible to have all of this when a woman is 25 but if the family father and mother together wants to start their career first they cannot be judged there is not a perfect moment to have a child sometimes to wait involve do better in conclusion i believe that there are not disadvantages to be outweighted the two possible disadvantages i presented are not worst than those people having children at their young age have to deal with ,6.0

Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,over the past decades it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age there could be different reasons for this and i am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs which will also explain why i believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages apparently the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years sometimes without us even noticing it the most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births in fact owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s many people see this as a negative aspect for our society however i have to strongly disagree with their opinion the drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children admittedly someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and as a result the issues of miscommunication that could arise however the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined first of all older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers consequently due to their broader life experience they would arguably make better advisors for their kids not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children s further education which in turn could help the latter having a better and well paid job in the future to conclude although it s impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age the advantages still outrun the disadvantages thus children would be the first to benefit from such a situation ,8.5

2,More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,it is true that today people tend to give birth when they are older than their previous generation this trend has several negative and positive effects on their daily life on the one hand there are several disadvantages for those who want to have children in their later age first moms could suffer from many serious health problems when they give birth late those who are older than 35 of age has the higher rate of death because their hormone levels are not suitable for giving birth which lead to medical accidents second boys or girls whose their mother is older than 35 also tend to suffer from many problems for example it is easier to have pneumonia for children from those mothers because the preterm birth rate of this group of mothers is higher on the other hand i am on the side with those who believe that there are more benefits to having children when they are older firstly people could prepare a better foundation for their children raising a boy or a girl is a job which needs both much effort money and time therefore many people decide to work hard and earn much money they can because it could build a more solid infrastructure for their children secondly it is important for children to have both their parents during their process of growing up the rate of crime in terms of teenagers who grow up without mother or father is higher than those who live with parents thus the decisions such as having marriage or giving birth are crucial when the younger tend to decide quickly in conclusion it is still controversy for this trend because of the positive and negative effects mentioned above ,7.5

Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",at present it is possible to note that families come in different and diverse structures overall these changes occur because of women are entering the work force which changes the roles of a traditional family i strongly believe that these changes are positive to society and to the economy in the following paragraphs i will present my reasons to have such opinion one major factor that affects family structures is women being allowed to work outside their homes within the last century women joined the work force modifying the traditional family setting that was compoused by men being the ones who provided for their families therefore the roles changed as both mothers and fathers could financially provide for their children moreover women do not need to rely on their husbands to raise children as they have jobs themselves and they might even decide to raise a baby by their own creating a new type of family strucutre that is comprised of only a mother and a child furthermore couples can even decide not to have children at all and only focus on their carreers as women have the possibility of being a lot more than mothers these changes are definitly positive of an economical and societal point of view women are now part of the work force therefore they contribute for the economy besides that changes in family structures and roles make people more tolerant as they see that there is no limitation for what a women can do to summarize there are indeed several changes occurring in families structures and the roles people play in it women being part of the work force has changed male and female contribution to a family which has a positive impact socially and economically speaking ,6.0

2,"There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",the world today is often divided into two categories more developed and less developed countries this division is significant in terms of health wealth and education to minimise this gap it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy i personally feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies to address this argument the history of the wealthy countries is relevant many less developed countries are former colonies therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy thus richer countries economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status furthermore even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health education and basic necessities for themselves in addition simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap it would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems allowing these countries to be self sufficient in conclusion while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient a more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives ,9.0
2,"Some people like to own the place where they live, but other people like to rent where they live. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",the debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side there are persuasive arguments for both points of view one of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility usually a tenant only has to give a month s notice before changing where he or she lives if a property is owned and a change is needed the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed sometimes the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family s capital is not tied up in the property property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more if one rents this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family s quality of life if the property is on a mortgage then the deposit also often very large is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress owning a property does have various advantages though even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments this money is then built up with the property with renting the money is lost to the landlord but at the end of the term of the mortgage the whole property is owned by the family this makes the process of living in a property a type of investment in addition the property s value often goes up after time frequently creating a substantial profit owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well being and self actualisation the decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference my opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family ,9.0
2,People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,it is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do this is shown when you realise how people s work and how much time effort and resources they devote to it is often the subject of conversation most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives necessities and luxuries and so work can naturally become a dominating focus as this is an important part of nearly everyone s everyday life it can seem that people s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable in many developed countries around the world there are procedures in place to help people with finding work providing unemployment benefits ensuring education and offering pension payments in times past these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income therefore in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one s job and perform well at it this in turn would lead to people s lives being less influenced by their jobs today it is also true that in the past people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so in this respect the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today while i agree that people s lives today are often dominated by their jobs i feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before in fact it may be more positive due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries ,9.0
2,It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,traditionally in many parts of the world it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children this has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men the overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and following that they are the ones who for the early part of a child s life have to feed the child until it is weaned in times past this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children whilst men went out to work whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories in spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women it is very possible for men to care for a child even from birth onwards in today s world babies milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child the fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude not many people whether they are men or women feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start they need advice from their own mothers and fathers midwives or from books it is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender all in all i do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women i believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament not gender specific inherited qualities ,9.0
2,Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,high rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world they are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves the most significant advantage of high rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners with land often being at a premium in large cities one way to maximise space is to build upwards so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased the demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met there are also disadvantages for town planners the heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities for example sewage and other waste disposal and the provision of adequate school and medical services there are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high rise apartment blocks with the demand for housing being reduced prices are therefore not as high making housing more affordable many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden and living in an apartment has this advantage finally with so many people living in the same area many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up it appears the most significant disadvantage is that in practice living in high rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want in some city neighbourhoods these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements in addition many people view high rise apartment blocks as being unsafe for example in the case of fire tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely it is clear that high rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks it is also clear however that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities these architectural features are here to stay whether people like them or not ,9.0
2,"Some people feel that fashion is like art and a significant part of society, while others feel that fashion is a waste of time and money.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",the fashion industry today is an important component of society and people s lives it is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them however this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money when one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty disease and inadequate access to food and clean water the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life this point is hard to argue with however it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait the fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries it provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society there is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury the high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and like other art forms there will always be people who appreciate it want to create it and want to spend money on it it is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change i therefore feel that although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources fashion is an important part of today s society and economic output this leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice ,9.0
2,"Many people believe that studying at university is the best way to develop oneself, learn new skills and find a well-paid job. Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",there are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills traditional educational routes such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today s society it can be argued however that this is not always the best way a more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs universities generally have deference given to them and due to this most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise the very difficulty of gaining admission getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self discipline intelligence and ability to get through the courses universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects for example medicine law and literature and these subjects need students full time attention in order to do well although vocational experience is necessary a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high level is important once this knowledge has been acquired students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding this however is not the case for all areas of learning especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples to do this work well requires a lot of experience yet also a sound understanding of theory the learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience therefore in my opinion there are more ways than one to acquire a profession whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job ,9.0
2,The end of the world’s fossil fuel resources and the subsequent changes will be a positive development in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,today s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels most people would initially think about fuel for transport but of course fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences however i believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them depending on whether eco friendly alternatives are developed the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant exhaust fumes from motor vehicles planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect people s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels it could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go this however does not have to be a bad thing as it could force society to use alternative solutions such as transport sharing and public transport development the change in mind set has already begun some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy such as wind power solar power hydropower and tidal power technologies would improve and be more efficient and again the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution this development can also be seen today with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources i therefore strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive the only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon in order to avoid an energy crisis ,9.0

2,Having a salaried job is better than being self-employed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,if one wants to work for money there are really only two options working for someone else for a salary and being self employed most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages being self employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done this might be a small one person business or a large company with hundreds of employees the first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money if the business does very well the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits on the other hand if business is not good the owner s income will be low self employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business with this autonomy however comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one s employees if there are any to do their best to make the business thrive salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self employed owners of companies they might have stress in their duties but the pressure that comes with keeping one s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one s family is just not felt by an employee the employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income as the salary is usually fixed every month the self employed owner s income often depends on how successful the business is the employee s fixed income however does not give much scope for earning large amounts more in addition an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy and for many people having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well being it is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self employed and salaried i personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self employed i prefer the autonomy that being self employed brings and although there is more risk and pressure this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards ,9.0
2,Some people feel that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child’s education. Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,throughout the history of education learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component of course many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone but this is not a point of view that i share the opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country in addition to this out of all the countries of the world comparatively not many share the same language therefore learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used for some people the language might never be used in their entire lives when one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers buying resources going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources however the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip firstly through learning one language one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work thus no matter where people might end up around the world the knowledge of language can be of use secondly with the study of a foreign language one also opens oneself up to other cultures this allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems with an ever shrinking world due to globalisation the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society finally quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills it seems to me that learning a foreign language therefore is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue it is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today s schools ,9.0
2,"With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",it is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can t be will soon be changed to a digital format some people therefore believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed if one looks at this issue dispassionately it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally it only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields the costs involved with setting typing printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper an actual library building would be totally unnecessary as all one would need would be a virtual library as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal there would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed this would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding logic however is not always the best approach to everything print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight many people including younger readers feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages there will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries libraries will continue to be especially important as not all older people use computers and e readers as much as the younger generation they will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them in addition if only a few books in print are available in the future libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events education and childcare ironically libraries also provide computers and internet access for people who cannot afford their own in spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books i feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books this state of affairs might change in the future but at present they are important community resources ,9.0
2,It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,the responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this but others feel it is the responsibility of the state people who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees base their argument on the fact that in most countries people pay taxes and social charges to the government this money they argue should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax in addition those who have very small or no income pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves the government therefore in its role of caring for the population has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits such as medical treatment many others however feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements as adults they argue people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime so that they can retire with few financial worries in many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended i neither agree nor disagree with the statement but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments i feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement but i also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes in my view therefore it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area governments are there to support the entire population of their countries which includes the poorer elements of society ,9.0
2,Many cities have areas where the only cars are taxis and buses.Is this a positive or a negative development? What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport it has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience but many would agree that this is a small price to pay a reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles using public transport especially the types that run on clean sources of power will significantly raise air quality levels in cities which will of course benefit everyone the clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity this would contribute on an individual level to people s well being and a better and longer life and on a societal level it would lessen the strain on public health resources governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer in conclusion it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial better health and ecology as well as improvement in longevity and well being can benefit individuals and the entire society ,9.0
2,Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,it has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called work experience placements the children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work usually for around a week some people criticise this trend but i can t see how it can be a negative experience one of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork with the pressure to do well at school increasing children need every bit of help to maximise their potential taking them out of the school it is therefore argued stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week as the students won t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week it would therefore be better for them to remain at school while this is a valid point taking a child s entire experience of school into account a single week away does not make a significant difference indeed if the timing of the week s work placements is done correctly the week can also serve as a kind of holiday away from school something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic in many work placements children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning in addition to this schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives by getting this short taste of what it is like they can see that it is nothing to be scared about as well as this children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living but are not sure by allowing them to see a type of work they are considering they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them i feel therefore that work placements can be seen as a positive development missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant ,9.0
2,The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,it indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the internet seems to be increasing there can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light one explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing this can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation rather than a one off donation the increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of street salespeople who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment a second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable if these charities are all legitimate this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it the increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness people might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions if the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people s compassionate principles this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development if it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back it could be seen as a pessimistic development in addition if there are more charities asking for more money this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread which would be a negative development there could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today whatever the reasons as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions it must be seen as a positive development ,9.0
2,"Some people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",the benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school whereas others feel that the more work set the better it is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children the competition to do well to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant this has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development the argument however that more is better is not always valid there comes a point especially for a child when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day when a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects he or she is processing a lot of information already to give more work to be done at home therefore would be pointless and even counterproductive in addition to this although it is important to be educated childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this on the other hand it can be argued that there is a place for homework if study at school is not overdone the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise it s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once but if that concept is revisited a second time the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember it seems to me that there is a place for homework for today s children what must be remembered though is that homework needs to be limited to age appropriate parameters so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation ,9.0
2,It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,it is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime there are various reasons for this but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening one reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money when such person comes out of prison it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income in fact these opportunities will even be reduced as employers are often less willing to give an ex prisoner a job some people also return to crime as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals this is not a great environment for rehabilitation and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release one important way to help address this problem is education criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage such as a trade or vocational skills computer skills for example are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work in addition governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly released prisoners this would help people who don t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start as keeping people in prison is an expensive business governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives to sum up people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today s society education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place ,9.0
2,"Social media has become a real problem for some young people today, and governments should create laws that allow only people over 18 years of age to have accounts.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population especially the younger generation many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment however not everyone is able to use social media responsibly which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age though there are negatives such as cyber bullying or being too distracted by these modern media there are issues surrounding most things in life it is a choice to go onto a social media website and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties it is not the government s responsibility to monitor under eighteen year olds that is for the parents statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media it allows them to chat online easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world and see updates on others lives through text photos or videos social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world to not permit one of the largest internet using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction not only would profit be lost with fewer users but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well i believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen this would be unnecessary and absurd ,9.0
2,"With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world s modern economy with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries this has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries a worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when euro was developed for europe trade could be significantly encouraged as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies moreover tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling however there are certain risks to a global currency which definitely do not make it an unquestioned benefit countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable which could develop into a severe economic issue for example the us regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession also economic problems such as in greece have actually been made worse by the use of the common euro if applied worldwide many countries economies could be very similarly negatively impacted finally many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency if weaker countries were to adopt a world currency this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency in conclusion the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low it seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits as if a country were to lose economic stability the world would be impacted as well for that reason i feel that in present circumstances it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession ,9.0
2,"In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",in many countries around the world boys and girls are educated together there is a group of countries however that educate boys and girls separately this is frequently done on religious grounds but not always having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages one of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that if they are together they can distract each other after puberty boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as for example they show off to one another separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour however some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class and sometimes more so these teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily there is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened a major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis this can lead to shyness and more seriously dysfunctional relationships later in life some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them in conclusion i feel that children should be educated all together although i would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs my personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other ,9.0
2,Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries to deal with this many people feel that a small proportion of everyone s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor this could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless it is clear that this is not enough in the u s alone a very developed country in itself nearly two million people are homeless these facilities can lend a helpful hand however they do not help eradicate the problem those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs or if they are lucky to gain employment the pay may not be enough to support them and their families if a small percentage of everyone s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor the suffering of many people could be alleviated however this is not a perfect world and taxes are high enough for many people a similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is as governments have so many financial responsibilities already though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it people need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and although governments already have too many calls on their available funds in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless ,9.0
2,Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,the amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day and all this can be difficult to manage this has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household however opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the u s alone taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted however forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles the waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase and will most likely wish to continue to purchase taxing people may be a cause of resentment with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills in addition if people produce more than they are allowed this will encourage littering and dumping so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled and this in turn will damage the environment though controlling the amount of waste produced is important there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output in my opinion governments should encourage composting and recycling which will also reduce wasted material people should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced an education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations ,9.0
2,The fact that enormous sums are paid for pieces of art is not acceptable at a time when many people around the world live in poverty. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,it is true that pieces of art in today s world can change hands for enormous sums works by artists such as picasso da vinci and rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars recently a modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars it certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty the work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed medicines food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided saving lots of lives many of which would be children when the issue is looked at from this point of view the art sales world certainly seems obscene however in my opinion things are unlikely to change human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth lots of prosperous people support many charities but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives the works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit in conclusion in an ideal world the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need in reality however this is unlikely to take place ,9.0
2,Professional sportsmen and sportswomen and professional entertainers can often command enormous salaries today and this situation reflects society’s dependence on being entertained.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,it is no secret that today s entertainment industry is extremely popular with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching tv shows movies and sports games the north american sports industry alone generates a massive 67 7 billion every year with the present emphasis on entertainment sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries with figures in the millions for one game appearance or film this situation certainly does reflect today s society s obsession with entertainment many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid a list celebrities can make over 20 million per movie whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person this is a fairly naive point of view though so long as people wish to watch entertainment advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else while it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life changing scientific discovery their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value in conclusion it is clear that today s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this the high payments however are not necessarily out of place or undeserved ,9.0
2,"Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",punishing children with physical force or corporal punishment as it is also called is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it nowadays however corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education of course part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not or should not be excessive they do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut they argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied people who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them additionally children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems it is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse personally i do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings nevertheless i would not use it myself i can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child s parents misusing corporal punishment therefore i believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted ,9.0
2,"Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from europe to singapore crossing nearly the whole globe based on this simplicity tourism has changed significantly over the years while in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world this also has a downside as increased pollution is a result extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity no matter what major transportation is used travelling creates pollution to decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened if these increased taxes are based on travelling distance people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled therefore if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation tourism and therefore pollution would decrease on the other hand the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones such as planes trains and buses and increasing the taxes would also impact non tourists also holidays are a vital part of ordinary people s lives as they escape from work and stress and get to spend valuable time with their families stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life in conclusion while tourism impacts the environment significantly simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure it could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution instead making people stay close to home ,9.0
2,Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,in modern day society money is a driving force for nearly everyone most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want however not everyone is able to find paid employment and for that reason in some countries around the world governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive some people believe it is an excellent idea whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country s financial resources when looking at the positive aspects of this system it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy when somebody becomes unemployed he or she will have on going costs such as rent for a dwelling bills for water telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things without a salary this person will fall into debt because they will be unable to cover these expenses a national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time without such system many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive therefore one can say that this system is positive although stories are heard of people exploiting the system usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again meaning that the government does not have to support them for long although there are positive aspects of this system one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high it will prevent people from looking for work actively occasionally the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries deterring them from working and creating an on going cost for the government a potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income which would motivate this group to re enter the workforce in conclusion the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects personally i believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative the payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time ,9.0
2,"With the increase in computer use, many people feel that schools do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mental mathematics skills.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",in recent years computer use around the world has increased drastically as a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills the use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment hence it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers electronic devices also offer various learning advantages as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools nonetheless the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers for that reason students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills such as writing it is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand furthermore final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it mathematics skills are no different people will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today s world in conclusion i personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators this balance is important as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects the student will face problems later on in life ,9.0

What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",to perform well in a job people have to be motivated there are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees the most obvious one is the salary however job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work for the majority of the people receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation this is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money furthermore performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages to receive this staff have to stand out positively in their jobs salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants however money is far from being the only incentive another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction if a person is comfortable in their work they are more likely to perform well therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary as when people are content and perform well the chances of promotion increase for some individuals though only their passion can drive them prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs the salaries are often not very high but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary in conclusion while income might be the most common motivational factor it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons ,9.0

Discuss both views and give your opinion.",public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world with many populations facing rising rates of obesity diabetes and other diet related diseases this has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices in my view everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice the argument for government imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line for example government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products especially those marketed to children and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars this approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food necessary to make informed decisions by providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy and by taxing the unhealthy options higher the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options however there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention these types of regulations infringe upon individuals right to choose what they put in their bodies after all everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves additionally there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run since people s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items in conclusion while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one s diet is concerned governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume this way they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles ,8.0
2,More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?,an alarming number of people today consume sugar based drinks whether it is in the form of soda energy drinks or fruit drinks often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience however marketing campaigns also play a role targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are the availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time they can now be found in almost any store or restaurant which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone the fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives such as water or freshly squeezed juice makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on tv and billboards this encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society luckily reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible if we act now and attack the problem from different angles one of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products health benefits without fully understanding what s being sold to them schools colleges and universities and any institutions catering for young people should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar overall it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long term wellbeing through greater education government regulation and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options ,8.0
2,"Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?",it is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities from singers to actors many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles in my opinion allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental as they frequently set a poor example many of today s celebrities tend to lack moral values and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people for instance some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence in addition the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage these types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful poor morals aren t the only issue as many popular stars are also well known for their irresponsible spending habits they routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly this kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life meaningful relationships knowledge and hard work to conclude young adults should keep in mind that society s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary insubstantial things rather than what actually matters in the grand scheme of things it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships ,8.0
2,Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?,many people strive to achieve a work life balance but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts this is not surprising as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors one of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours this has led to an expectation that employees should always be available and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not a knock on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well being this type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout with no respite from life s pressures resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time helping those struggling to find a suitable work life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees workers for instance need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days this will give employees space both mentally and physically enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves in conclusion achieving a successful work life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime however these issues can be overcome if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time ,8.0
2,In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?,in today s ever increasingly digital world online communication has become the norm for many workplaces while this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication which must be weighed against its benefits one of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene this is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances reduced travel costs as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings also represent meaningful savings for businesses additionally online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members to illustrate digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like dropbox or google drive there is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face to face meetings however in my opinion issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues in conclusion when online communication tools are used properly they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication quality or efficiency ,8.0
2,"Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?",the benefits of walking are numerous and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit despite this the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline the reasons for this are manifold but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity these days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities as a result they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport such as cars bikes or public transport another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety most full time workers are not free to walk during the day and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours if they do not feel safe enough to do so fortunately there are quite a few solutions to this issue one is making walkers safe which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much needed exercise in the evenings the added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive to conclude the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns ,8.0
2,"In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?",despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world in my opinion the main reason for this is that people in the first world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing and fortunately there are some ways to tackle this issue it is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores for example veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged in addition a lot of customers confuse the best by and use by dates thinking that foods that have passed their best by dates are no longer fit to eat another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used there are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted and i think one of the best ideas is to increase people s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised also teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need it would be great for the environment and their budget the role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation to conclude the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world it is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation ,8.0
2,Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?,many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think there are numerous ways in which this affects our society and i believe that this influence is mostly negative newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles well established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention grabbing images and carefully worded commentary this leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read sadly unbiased objectivity which used to be the core idea behind journalism seems to be a thing of the past the arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs this gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales as a result the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever to make matters worse there are plenty of well documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated all in all although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers it is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future ,8.0
2,Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?,raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues however i strongly disagree with this idea as doing so would make life difficult for lower income households while making fuel more expensive wouldn t change the habits of wealthy families switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment the most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure they will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices even if their country has state of the art public transportation those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle class and lower income households since travelling is a major part of most people s routine be it to work school or shopping driving is almost unavoidable in many instances therefore raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives due to the rapid advances in technology scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel the move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive in conclusion i believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly rather than simply raising the cost of petrol ,8.0
2,"Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",while some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters in my opinion the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned however in some instances government intervention is necessary on one side of the argument there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents shoulders since they are their first educators and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school in addition every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails therefore some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh to overcome this issue they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home unfortunately not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way therefore the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school i believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation also this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school in conclusion while both views are commonly held in society i believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well being and successful development of the youth ,8.0
2,"These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?",nowadays the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism it seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors gaming or engaging in other online activities if that is the case by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions the schools could counteract this trend living in the era of technology the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors using their gadgets numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement such as online games videos audiobooks and plenty of other activities tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles a recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games rather than in the nature that is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports to address this issue the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions both within the school curriculum and as extra curricular activities for example high schools could increase the number of weekly football running and climbing classes and organise competitions at the end of each term as a result pushed by their desire to win students would do more walking jogging running and mountaineering during the school term in preparation for the competition this would reduce the time spent online lessen the students dependence on the internet for entertainment and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment to sum up screen addiction plays a major role in young people s avoidance of various outdoor activities opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature ,8.0
2,"Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?",international sporting events are well known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to understandably there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship worryingly the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built worse still practice shows the expensive gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair leaving the country with high maintenance bills the financial burden from hosting the olympic games for example is staggering and can run into tens of billions still the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons it is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event new trade opportunities appear on the horizon as it happened for many countries that hosted the olympic games there is also a welcome increase in tourism which gives the local economy a boost injecting billions of dollars into the national budget construction of new stadiums hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs further improving the country s economy less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel good factor associated with hosting an international sports event all in all it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised hosting a world championship is a one in a lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens ,8.0
2,"People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",the globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country as everyone comes from their own cultural background a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country i completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society in many cultures following the local customs means showing respect which is an important moral value in nearly every culture the opposite is also true disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect in order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community by expressing an interest in learning traditions new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues get to know them and build some connections in the new country another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing when a national festival is in full swing standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together go to parties meet new people and feel part of the celebrations in australia for example easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include easter egg decoration and gifting and baking hot cross buns sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter in conclusion learning the customs and traditions of one s new country doesn t mean a loss of their own culture on the contrary it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience ,8.0
2,"Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",the cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world it is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation s own art and not that of other countries in my opinion there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent if people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums that would have a number of positive effects such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen it would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest potentially resulting in further development of the local art however in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides the evolution of local arts may be hindered people enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant talent knows no geographical boundaries therefore the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings rather than on its origin if that principle were to be followed we would never have to choose between local and international art reducing our museums or galleries collections to local art works in my view would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art to sum up it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world a conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial ,8.0
2,Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?,young people today are under a lot of pressure which seems to come from many directions the problems they are experiencing happen not only at school but also at home and it seems that without adult guidance our young generation will continue to struggle teenage years have never been simple and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time bullying has been a problem for quite a while and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past but then it would stop at home at present however things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers the unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms causing them constant distress another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families whether at school or at home they often feel as if they are not smart enough which creates overwhelm and despair understandably their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life however many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don t live up to their expectations this often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students work when uncovered these incidents have a profound effect on young people s future careers not to mention their emotional well being it is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person from helping teens build a positive body image and self esteem to handling classmates difficult behaviour to guidance where study is concerned parents can make a world of difference talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them listening and making non judgmental suggestions are great ways to help getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance last but not least parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love to sum up being a young person in the modern world isn t easy by banding together and paying careful attention to their teens families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults ,8.0
2,"Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?",nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way in my opinion innovation in crime prevention can be a game changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals therefore raising the crime rates such tools can indeed cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands however it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies statistically many of them tend to have a lower level of education and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels law enforcement workforce on the other hand has a much better grip on modern technology nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training take regular skill update courses and use high tech equipment facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors cctv video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves the combined effort will no doubt push the crime curve down to sum up even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes and law abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property rather than felons this will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place ,8.0
2,Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,it is often said that all influential tv entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people s awareness about social issues that matter while some tv programs could be suitable for this purpose i disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the tv content and the channel s audience there is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world stock traders and bankers for example must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite tv shows young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from tv programmes for instance sdgs or the sustainable development goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school educational tv would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks making learning more fun despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in tv programs it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment tv is for people to escape reality to take a break from their hectic lives being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance this would make tv shows of light hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues in conclusion entertainment tv programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information however not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them ,8.0
2,"In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?",in this fast moving age with the development of education and modern technologies people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities despite their efforts so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long term job it so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students academic performance much more than their practical skills unfortunately many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned the situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans that shrinks the pool of available job placements even more as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff fortunately there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment an obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students or arrange workshops in addition to classwork this would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields also the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits this way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves to sum up lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position helping them gain hands on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them ,8.0
2,Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?,in the past two decades there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development however there has been a long standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives one of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways tenants living in vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town to reduce their commute time moreover the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport thriving job market and affordable healthcare this would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people on the other hand accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution free and clean environment this is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike as a result their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications a recent report released by the word health organization who suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20 higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago in conclusion while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well therefore a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project ,8.0
2,"Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",choosing a future career requires careful consideration while some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy others oppose to that arguing that teenagers should aim for a high paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs i strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests the youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense it is true that some professions such as engineers or doctors are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other non professional fields for example psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions people who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about that doesn t pay well however it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a guaranteed future is unrealistic even the smartest of us aren t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future some high salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults therefore people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now to avoid having regrets later in life having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one s interests i am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love ,8.0
2,"In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?",the feasibility of shopping working and communicating through the internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in person encounters i believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay one chief benefit of using the internet as a means of making purchases working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport through eradicating the need for face to face contact such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment furthermore reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals it could be spent in various ways such as working studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few which would be more productive and enjoyable another key merit of using the internet would be the emergence of state of the art telecommunication applications these technologies have made it possible for those with access to the internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons this presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago when long distance communication was possible solely through paper based letters which could possibly take months to reach the recipient there are however some drawbacks to online communication in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds taking into consideration that humans are sociable species this could pose a dire threat to our mental health this predicament however would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us this free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing to recapitulate the internet s demolishing the need for person to person contact brings about numerous benefits a more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long distance communication in the easiest way possible are all instances of the above mentioned merits ,8.0

To what extent do you agree or disagree?",parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school aged children they are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology and i wholeheartedly share their view this essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills which are involved in learning to write time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words since the autocorrect and autocomplete features use the first few letters to guess the entire word therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages where words are shortened or distorted exposure to texting tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds causing their spelling accuracy to decline reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill however it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video watching easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books to sum up modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children depending on the choices adults in their lives make regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for ,8.0
2,It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity whereas watching television does very little for these abilities personally i support this opinion for several reasons which will be laid out in this essay as we all know books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book therefore we have to use our own imagination while reading for example reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot in contrast movie heroes on a tv screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film watching tv substitutes the need to develop one s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen furthermore it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one s vocabulary the reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book and they grasp its meaning from the context without having to look it up in a dictionary not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books to take advantage of these benefits english teachers in many schools use english novels as teaching materials students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam in comparison learning new words while watching a tv show isn t always easy because the viewer s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles the spelling of the words is not obvious all this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to tv in conclusion i believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context ,8.0
2,"Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today s world one part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation others on the other hand believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level this essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered it is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals for instance a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient moreover consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and in turn less plastic waste will contaminate the environment however many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes one option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees moreover politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels ranging from special courses at schools to tv shows and websites related to this topic furthermore it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment countries where legislation protects the ecology for example norway have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems in conclusion i believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes a contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations ,8.0
2,Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?,a trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more tv than ever before one of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries this tendency has both pros and cons and will be further discussed in this essay the latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching tv compared to the past with interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the tv a recent survey showed that tv addiction among young people for example has significantly increased from 5 to 80 which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles this increase is also partially due to films drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms this trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens more time spent watching tv adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child for instance the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression however tv can also be used in a positive way it is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers in conclusion recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their tv screens this can do more harm than good if we don t regulate the use of tv but parents have the power to make tv time useful and beneficial for their children ,8.0
2,"High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?",some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high rise buildings other cities create more of low rise buildings which solution is better in your opinion sample essayrising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand however when it comes to construction there is more than one way to build new homes some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers while others build a larger number of low rises for their residents in this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested one advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint this type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive for example in new york city high rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems by as much as 55 in the last few years as a result of this strategy rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities however tall buildings offer little or no privacy they force certain rules and regulations upon residents and attract higher maintenance costs given a chance to voice their opinion many individuals would prefer to live in low rise buildings or even build their own houses this option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them in addition one or two story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers the downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land and since land is cheaper on city fringes new estates tend to be built away from city centres this increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life in conclusion high rise and low rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages in my opinion high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent closer to the city centre and employment opportunities senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city s population ,8.0
2,« Previous,nowadays celebrities earn more money than politicians what are the reasons for this is it a positive or negative development sample essaynowadays celebrities make more money compared to people working in politics this essay will look at the possible causes of this tendency and explain why in my opinion this is a negative development there are two main reasons why celebrities generate more income than politicians one of them is that with the advent of the internet there are more ways available for celebrities to earn money such as online streaming services for example singing a song in a youtube video with some advertisements enables them to easily make a few million dollars another cogent reason for this is the growing global concerns over excessively high remuneration for political leaders which can easily lead to public discontent in response to such criticism many governments have decided to reform the reward system for lawmakers sending their salaries on a downward trend i personally believe that this development is relatively negative for several reasons with the main one being the potential corruption scandals this issue can create the enormous salary gap between celebrities and political leaders might discourage the legislators from putting in work or even motivate them to commit crimes such as money laundering in addition the relatively low salary for stressful jobs of governors may deter people with foresight on politics from becoming politicians this is particularly undesirable because it would result in low level of citizens loyalty to their incompetent government creating unstable society with more crime and other social problems in conclusion the fact that celebrities are paid more than political leaders now is caused by a wider variety of income sources available to them and supported by the social norm that a politician should not be a profit driven professional however i believe this is a negative trend which may lead to more political corruption and less talented governments ,8.0
2,"Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion)",some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field as long as they are playing well do you agree or disagree with this opinion sample essayalthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life while some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted not everyone agrees with that point of view those who put athletes performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior they argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public i find this hard to agree with because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in public s life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry the main reason why i believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior therefore if top players misbehave or violate laws some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly for example after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased this shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society in addition the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements if they demonstrate poor behavior sponsors could direct their money elsewhere and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds to illustrate sumo a traditional japanese sport is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies in a year when a sumo player was involved in a violent crime no matches were held resulting in a large deficit of funds in conclusion i completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself assessor s comment this response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse this response deserves a high score for task achievement because of that a good range of cohesive devices is used in this essay that and the organisation of ideas makes it easy to follow sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is quite rich the author also showed good control of grammar and spelling it is worth noting that this sample is longer than the recommended 260 285 words however this isn t an issue provided the author can complete an essay of this length and quality in under 40 minutes overall this is a good example of a band 8 essay ,8.0
2,"Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion)",some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job discuss both views and give your opinion sample essayin recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate while some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military i believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding as the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men in military service female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle which can increase their risk of mission failure because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields nevertheless i believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias because women are more suited to certain tasks in the police service female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts in the military service female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart warming professionals furthermore for the sake of fairness to all job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely regardless of gender many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications therefore they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs in conclusion although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands i believe that they should be treated as equal to men this is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities ,8.0
2,"In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?",in many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents home once they finish school they start living on their own or sharing a house with friends is this a positive or a negative development give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples sample essaynowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents home after graduation from school this trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay there are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school young adults in this way have to take care of their daily needs from house chores cooking or cleaning to financial independence thus instead of wasting time on childish activities they are motivated to learn skills and work part time or full time in order to cover their living expenses although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first it would give them valuable experience helping them to become mature responsible adults parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children but they also don t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation s lifestyle for instance it allows many people to travel around the world which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school admittedly there might be some challenges involved in this way of life in some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes however instead of keeping their children close through adulthood parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions in conclusion although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice i believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks for both children and parents ,8.0

2,"Nowadays that many women have full time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women (agree/disagree)",nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs therefore it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement nowadays an ever increasing number of women work full time and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally i strongly agree with this statement one of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality a stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home taking care of the family once they got married this includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework which is fairly labour intensive however this approach could have quite a few disadvantages it would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again to avoid this many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave and once they do it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores to fulfill their family responsibilities nevertheless we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend one potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks this is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework according to customs of many countries as a result they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners hindering their family bond however the likelihood of this happening isn t very high because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry to sum up although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious the writer covered the task well by discussing the positives and negatives of sharing housework equally between men and women each paragraph has a clear purpose and assists with orderly presentation of ideas making this essay easy to follow the ideas are explained and substantiated and the writer s opinion is clear the range of vocabulary is wide enough to avoid unnecessary repetition accuracy of expression could be improved see corrections underlined in blue but all in all this essay seems worthy of ielts band 8 ,8.0
2,"Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion)",some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement what is your opinion give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience it is true that when people advance into their golden years they require more help and attention for that reason a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly however i tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement to begin with a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country in other words if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age it would lessen the financial burden on the government as a result the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes such as development of infrastructure industries hospitals and so on which may expedite the overall progression of a country in addition to economic factors putting money aside has some personal benefits since savings oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses this may instill a sense of self respect and pride in them on the other hand those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society hence to live a life with dignity and pride taking responsibility for funding one s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective in contrast the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly the early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65 therefore in the foreseeable future these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable in conclusion the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent however considering the issue of sustainability of this provision it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life for the benefit of both individual and national development this response addresses all parts of the topic by discussing the merits of funding one s own retirement versus relying on government pension the writer s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear the neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay the author s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay overall this essay deserves an ielts band 8 ,8.0

2,Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?,while recruiting a new employee the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities rather than qualifications and experience to what extent do you agree or disagree give your opinion and include relevant examples recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries therefore recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises but how do we determine if a person is the best fit advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job nevertheless some people argue that candidates personal qualities cannot be ignored in my view both components are of equal importance to begin with the conventional approach of checking potential workers qualifications via their resumes linkedin profiles issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital apparently whenever we submit a job application we are always required to attach a cv while a cover letter is optional without a decent qualification even if that candidate s personal characteristics are suitable the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually on the other hand occasionally during an interview some hr officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates individual qualities can fit in the company employers should assess not only candidates qualifications but also their enabling skills ethics and value propositions the more an employee s personal qualities fit in a company s culture and values the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company s vision kpmg is a great example of evaluating candidates personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game based assessment process followed by a video interview this methodology enables a comprehensive assessment and is embraced by many companies nowadays to summarise employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent seeking enterprises this response covers the topic well the writer s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow linking words are used appropriately the use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive overall this essay is likely to score band 8 in ielts ,8.0

2,Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree),in many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company some people think this isn t justified do you agree or disagree while some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate not everyone agrees with this view personally i am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company for one executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary indeed the higher the remuneration they receive the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability furthermore they often gain powers that money can t buy for instance they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive they are also entitled to allocate company s budget and designate tasks to other workers these non financial entitlements they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees in fact it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers and theirs accordingly some may leave the company and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase however those actions therefore unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees in conclusion i oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system this is a good example of an ielts band 8 essay the task statement is sufficiently discussed and the writer s arguments are relevant and well developed there are only 2 body paragraphs but they are coherent and help to organise the information linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer s vocabulary some of the expressions used aren t entirely suitable or accurate but there aren t many of them overall this essay seems worthy of ielts band 8 0 ,8.0

2,should unpaid community work be mandatory in high school (agree/disagree)?,some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs for example working for a charity improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children to what extent do you agree or disagree it is argued that voluntary services charity cleaning the neighborhood imparting knowledge to the underprivileged should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum i strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character firstly community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society something that is needed to shape a good society for instance the introduction of swatch bharath scheme in my school the hyderabad public school ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever i go hence now i feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere such services are needed to develop a better society in the future secondly voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual it a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character for example an alumnus of montessori high school who indulged in petty law breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school which in his mind him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts thus such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development that being said we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning in conclusion although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development therefore pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities this is a well written essay it addresses all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are developed and supported the information is presented in a logical order and the ideas are linked by appropriate connective words the use of vocabulary conveys the exact meaning of the writer and there are only minor instances of a word being used somewhat unnaturally sentence formation demonstrates a high level of control and very few errors mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections overall this essay seems good enough for ielts band 8 level ,8.0

2,Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?,nowadays in our competitive world to succeed knowledge from school and university is not enough therefore students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills there are two following reasons to support for my opinion i refer to the group of people who study from school to university as group a and the other group as group b firstly at school and university what group a gains is almost entirely theory theory and theory of course theory is very however you can t do everything with just theory you must have experience this is what group a although in the third or fourth year at university group a can be apprentices in some companies to help them approach their future jobs they aren t trained well because of the short time spent working and the real job is still very strange to them after graduating without experience group a students can t accomplish their work perfectly on the other hand it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned therefore group a students can contribute less than group b who have the two most important things skills and experience secondly as group a students are contributing less they surely get less benefit moreover many companies which employ people in group a have to train them from ground up these companies take this cost from group a s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained so less benefits are unavoidable and certain group b members are more loyal and effective workers they also have useful experience and skills besides their education is the same as or even higher than that of group a as the result group b gets more benefits absolutely in conclusion i think a student should travel or work before going to the university that way not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future ,7.0
2,"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?",today computers are used almost everywhere it is impossible to imagine our life without pcs internet mobile phones and other computer devices it is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers computers make our life easier we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the internet and watch 3d scenes at home like we do in the movie theater according to forecasts of hr agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers and civil and military pilots some corporations in japan are already sellinghousewife robots which help old people to keep their homes clean despite the fact that computers help us they make us dependent apparently people spend more time behind monitors than ever before and some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact in addition a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s a problem related to the coming year 2000 y2k and catastrophes that were predicted fortunately imminent disasters did not happen however it is difficult to imagine what could if all the predictions came true we live in a technological era computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide and all dangers they hide however we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank them because they help us in communicating studying doing business entertaining and saving lives in critical situations ,7.0
2,"In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?",nowadays many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves however whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue i personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons it is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place this may be true however i would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid the recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes mopping floors or serving food in restaurants meanwhile this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future this brings me to the second point defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning the point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment although this is undoubtedly true it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class the worst thing is yet to come they may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school finally supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family they will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents this is true to a certain extent but may have a totally adverse effect on children as children can make money at an early age they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things in conclusion i think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future ,7.0
2,Some say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do to you agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?,a global village that is certainly what the world feels like nowadays with the help of the you can reach out and get to know people you might never have met in person articles can be co authored business deals can be finalized degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given and all of this is just a click away electronic mail instant messages web cameras and microphones all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real who knows with the help of visual reality you might even get a 3 d image of the speaker i believe that the internet is one the best inventions of the last century you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach you can keep in touch with your friends and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas however the internet can also be a major source of harassment spammers and hackers can invade your privacy and get personal confidential information which otherwise they never get access to you are never out of anybody s reach unless you make a conscious decision of not checking your email there can be always more work waiting for you in your inbox and you might never have a moment to yourself worse yet if you were a workaholic you might never experience that stress free vacation ever again in your life simply because you have your mobile workplace with you at all times as a romantic i will always look forward to getting an occasional letter in the snail mail a personal letter where i can sense the mood of the writer by the slants in his her handwriting and get to know him her better but as a type a personality person the internet gives me all what i dream of in terms of communication the speed reliability and convenience of time and place i can certainly tolerate its shortcomings any day as long as it keeps me close to my loved ones ,7.0
2,News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?, there are two factors that influence their decisions the first is the kind of customers they aim at each kind of readers and watchers has its own features for example if your customers are almost entirely teenagers you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories photographs of singer stars film stars funny tales and fashion it be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news on the contrary and politicians may never read news about james blunt or keira knightley therefore what influences news editors decisions the most is the taste of their customers the second factor is how hot and attractive the news is who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week the answer is in the energetic and competitive world nowadays people always ask for a really news so that to satisfy customers there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago or else they may lose their customers none of editors wants that bleak future the type of news is also an important consideration whether on television or in newspapers we seem to get more of and become used to bad news it is harder for us to come across a piece of good news we can t deny that bad things happen on earth day by day however news editors try to gain more and more which means more and more money using bad news as a magnet bad news makes us curious we want to know why it is bad what it is about whether it influences us or not as a result we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out and the happiest people are of course news editors in my view it would be better if more good news reported bad news makes us good news makes us happy there should an an equal amount of good and bad news in that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided nowadays we cannot live without news and for that reason the role of news editors became very important we should support them and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news both good and bad ,7.0
2,"Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",an essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken a single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution however every person should take care of his or her habitat in addition it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally lately many presentations conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment recycling and soil and water contamination joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster for instance governments should offer support to companies and organizations involved in manufacturing industry or agriculture in order to find environment friendly approaches these could be special law regulations recycling programs helping courses in order to implement iso certificates and many more however the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored if we do not that our planet is our home we will never be able to take care of it we have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment for example always remember to save energy by switching off lamps computers and everything that we do not use our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas driving vehicles can also be environment friendly for example we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows to sum up environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals every single person should take care of the environment moreover we have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet ,7.0
2,Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance in fact we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty but others vote in its favor portugal was the first european country to end this kind of penalty since the 19th century tolerance and respect for life important values moreover we can affirm that remains under the same codes maybe because of a religious view point the respect for life is a typical value in the old catholic world those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries however this is not just an image of the third world countries actually the usa is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application the state of texas in particular is at the top supporting this measure against crime especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children in a society dominated by fear and government control it is foreseen that this penalty will continue maybe this is not a simple question as we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior the roots of the question are religious cultural ethical and even geographical the world is divided and the law systems show this division the solutions however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice better to kill a person because of his crimes can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence in fact rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first some people are lost forever and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail in this sense capital punishment is an easy way out ,7.0
2,Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.,recently a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition in this i will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters safety according to my vision firstly tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect the active ingredient in tobacco exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker s brain cells numerous experiments carried out by on animals rats proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency similarly to the effect experienced with secondly the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure especially on teenagers to resist such a temptation dr hisham head of department at alexandria medical college states firmly giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step they will thank us for as they get older he continues to recapitulate applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact not only on young people s health but on our society as a whole ,7.0
2,Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?,i think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons firstly citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings therefore we can not look at hear of or talk about people who lack food education without compassion and sympathy sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a secondly many nations in africa and asia are poor famine diseases crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries many nations in europe and america are rich if there are no actions taken this inequality will increase dramatically poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer as a result the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries so sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future thirdly although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food medicine and education or else poor nations may become dependent on the aid they may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves moreover rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations this can t be considered a humane action and should be prevented in my opinion sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side what we have to do is its bad side and its good side ,7.0
2,"Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one.

You should write at least 250 words.",many people wonder about some people think that it has negative impact in our life however positive effect on this world of course for several reasons firstly it motivates the psychological point in everyone and women in particular they will run to buy this advertised product especially if it s from just to show their beauty to men which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention secondly you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing but it s nothing important it s just another company to convince you to buy one of their products it is a real lastly sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something but with these new methods of advertisement you run to buy it which affect your budget on the other hand there are some good sides to advertising for instance it compares the prices of many companies which the consumer besides it really see more products which we unless the tv or radio advertised them it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through in conclusion as we can see there are many aspects to this i feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement it plays buy more things that they do not need it at all ,7.0
2,"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?",in the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough this led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming these two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers the average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods this time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead moreover a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal on the other hand new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions this is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves as time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters in conclusion similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks i personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony ,7.0
2,"The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?",some people believe that internet access creates problems there are several possible reasons why it can happen firstly some data may be unverifiable for example they search for a data there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen they would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate some sources may even have outdated secondly some sites may be unreliable for instance people sign up on one site that sells goods online the goods would be paid for by a credit card but the purchaser would not receive anything and finally not everything is available through the net when my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings he did not find any results then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library others believe that the internet is very useful and these are the justifications firstly it is hard to get the same data that is available through the internet by other means for example if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place i to visit i normally check that information on the internet in just one click i would get all the details of that company secondly research becomes more comprehensive for instance i do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research most of the needed information can be found if i have internet access and finally data is easily compared and contrasted researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day as compared to a week if he would not use the internet in conclusion let me reiterate that the internet plays a big role in our life because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier ,7.0

2,Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,the world cup football and the olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations as a fan of those competitions i agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity but only partially because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries first of all the world cup olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations for example south and north korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other in the mid of north korean supporters came to south korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events even if it sounds ridiculous many south koreans were quite surprised at that moment when north koreans shouted and cried during the match we all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive through the sports two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity on the other hand some sports matches can make international relations worse for instance football or baseball games between korea and japan are always big matches in two countries where sometimes after the matches the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly ,7.0

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,nowadays it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern which incurs a highly charged debate obviously higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways for example higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most with a university degree students from rural areas obtain a job easily thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well higher education also however to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families ability to afford in addition with the mounting evidence a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job therefore their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation people argue students from rural areas are not well advised to pursue a university degree but i perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education in conclusion university education should be made fair to everyone predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need teacher s comment not all the parts of the task were covered the writer s position is relevant to task prompt the main ideas are also relevant but not all of them are developed well enough the information is presented coherently it is evident that the writer progresses from one idea to another ,6.0
2,Full time university students spend most of the time studying. They should be doing other activities too. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,full time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students other activities such as working for their pocket money sports participating in debates and people differ in their opinion if students must in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only the discussion will be presented below followed by my opinion some people say that mere studying does not youth for a country this way students only earn theoretical knowledge not practical for instance students can be their studies but at the same time when they they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university hence the best approach for them to be engaged here and there for practical experience on the other hand others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in today s world so they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can furthermore if they are diverted from their studies they will not be able to their in my point of view there must be blending of full time education and extra activities it refreshes students minds and provides more energy moreover by this way they will learn how to with other people in the society to summarize it can be said that it is important to concentrate on but on the other hand there must be something to keep active and relaxed being involved in games music work and other extra activities ,6.0

2,Every year an increasing number of students choose to go to another country for their higher education. Do you think the benefits of this development outweigh the problems associated with it?,the past twenty years have seen a dramatic change the number of students who go abroad in this essay i will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend on the one hand both students and their country can benefit from this trend first students can choose more suitable methods for themselves because there are more options the and teaching methods are quite different according to foreign experts secondly people can improve their foreign language they can contact with when they are in a foreign country and they quickly master the foreign language thirdly it helps to promote the mutual understanding between their mother land and their destination countries these students exchange information with the locals students can get better understanding of the countries people in their home country will get more vivid information about other countries similarly the locals also can get more clear recognition about other countries on the other hand there are disadvantages too firstly it costs people a lot of money to begin college in foreign countries many families have to take out all their savings to support their children abroad secondly some students cannot stand the big difference the new environment they quit their study and come back home to conclude given the fact that in foreign countries helps students with their studies and promotes the mutual understanding countries even if there are some drawbacks i think the benefits outweigh the problems ,6.0
2,Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,in many countries the discussion about financial education getting more serious due to financial problems of young generation some people that financial education should be considered a mandatory subject at school the common problem for those young people is that they don t know how to spend money in right way as we can see many advertisements often carry out the message only 10 dollars a week no deposits which is misleading think that living in debt is normal financial education is one of the solutions for the basic idea of financial education as a core school subject is to teach those young ones to understand the concept of using money and to estimate a risk of borrowing money to buy something in the future however another factor we need in my opinion the role of financial education is getting more important and it should be a part of the school program but the parents are also important and have responsibility to how to manage the money more than 70 of young people s money is from their parents in addition it has to be considered that a student might become person talking about money all the time in class or even in a public place it can be harmful for some students and affect their normal social life in conclusion i that financial education will have a positive effect on all young ones and other such social commutations should be considered just as important as financial education ,6.0
2,The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?,with the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road lack of experience forgetfulness carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers on the other hand i would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road thus i would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road to sum up age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but i do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method as mentioned in my third paragraph we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents ,6.0

2,"Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Discuss.",everything has two sides and the globalization is not exception our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global mcdonaldisation and generally speaking spreading across the whole globe firstly i would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation as far as economy is concerned like the global bank or imf are always focused on developing the third world and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles through loans and donations moreover the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts e g philosophical or economical doctrines which become popular due to lack of barriers however disadvantages of globalization are also widely known some people insist that because of this process the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears the integrity established years ago is on the verge of collapsing furthermore there s a strong lobby of communists who that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour class we should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization to sum up globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life i can t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it however we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities they have a great value which should last forever ,6.0

Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?",in the third world children are usually sent to factories for laborious work many people believe that it is merely exploitation while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience in any case children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions therefore using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action first of all children are not workers they have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working since these innocent children are naive and they can be easily cheated and exploited there are many examples of this in poor nations because using children is cheap and to control many enterprises hire them and don t pay them much although the government in these countries has tried its best this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated moreover children do not need such thing as valuable work experience that is supposedly important for learning and taking responsibility the brief responsibility of children is learning they are not old enough to understand what working experiences are nevertheless they can help parents do chores or housework this will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for in addition childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work in conclusion since all children are the great concern of parent and society they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work hence one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children ,6.0

2,The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?,traffic accidents are on the rise these days most of the accidents injuries or death research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers for example young drivers young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one they tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car drunk driving will not only risk a person s own life but may also cause an life to be lost the government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period this will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again however for the aged drivers the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving it does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days to conclude i feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness as for the drivers as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn t be a problem ,6.0

2,Some people say education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,one the one hand good education is a highly recommended skill in the developed countries on the other hand of many people in regions of poverty but what makes education key factor for the development of a countrywe must acknowledge that education is something that we all need the differences are just what we learn mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family nevertheless there must be a reason for education for me it looks like some countries have realized that education is the key for the globalization process if we take india for example we can see that a change in the educational system had changed the economy of the country country has changed from a poor region to a high potential for it knowledge in regard to this fact of education seriously and offer it to a wide range of people spending money education is the key tippy title for to tippy a new future effects on the economy and social life all in all i agree with the importance of education for the development of a country less knowledge leads to poverty and learning and knowledge is power and an investment in the near future and therefore it has to be an official task ,6.0
2,Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,in many countries the discussion about the rising financial problems of young people has been getting more emphasis some people are voting to integrate financial education as a the key problem for many young people is that they don t know how to use and spend money in the right way the get what you want mentality is widely advertised by the mass media and it looks like some people think that living is normal though financial problems in young life are very common with the result that the main idea of teaching a financial subject must be to explain about a balanced budget and that debt could ruins one s future this is just one side that has to be considered for me the main question is why the parents cannot give the right advice to their kids to leave such a personal subject in the hands of government and school means to ignore a key task of any parent to be a good role model moreover it should be that the social effects of talking about money and finance in a socially diverse school class can be harmful for some students in my opinion it is more important to teach parents about their responsibilities as a role model and have them educate the children about this private topic in a safe and private environment all in all i think the main task of public institutions should be to educate about common subjects and not to give such personal advice like the use of money ,6.0

2,Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.,it is true that nowadays have a great influence children some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent but others as far as i am concerned my arguments for this point are listed below first of all a father is the person who have already passed ways his son is passing now in other words sons are following their father s footsteps based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons drawbacks and to influence them secondly it is true that a boy is a girl is a subtle and fragile one it is hard for mothers to influence their sons because it is not likely that can affect a strong one in conclusion it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers based on at least two points above i strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender ,5.0
